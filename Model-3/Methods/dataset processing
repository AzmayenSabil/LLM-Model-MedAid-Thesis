Dataset Preparation:

	Format: Use a question-answer format dataset with:
	Context: A brief description of the patient's condition or reason for visit.
	The doctor's question to elicit symptoms.
	Answer: The patient's response describing their symptoms.
	Sources:
		> medical interviews or conversations with actors playing patients.
		> existing medical conversation datasets like 
			>> MIMIC-III or 
			>> Open Dialogue Medical Dataset



1. Cleaning:
	Remove irrelevant information,
	Standardize formatting
2. Structuring:
	Segment into dialogue turns,
3. Augmentation:
	Data synthesis: Use techniques like back-translation or paraphrasing to artificially increase the size and diversity of your dataset.
	Question pattern variations: Generate variations of the doctor's questions based on existing ones to encourage diverse responses and improve the model's ability to handle different prompts.
	Symptom paraphrases: Include variations in how symptoms are described by patients to improve the model's ability to recognize them in different wordings.
4. Splitting:
	Train-validation-test split
