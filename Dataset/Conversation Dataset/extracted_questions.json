    "q_590": "OK, and are you otherwise healthy?",
    "q_591": " You mentioned you have high blood pressure, anything else?",
    "q_592": "OK. Have you had any investigations done for your chest like pulmonary function tests, ECG's, chest X-rays?",
    "q_593": "OK, so you're not on any medications?",
    "q_594": "And do you smoke?",
    "q_595": "A pack a week, OK?",
    "q_596": " For how long?",
    "q_597": "OK OK. Um, do you smoke marijuana?",
    "q_598": "Yeah, OK. Any other recreational drugs?",
    "q_599": "No, OK. How about alcohol?",

    "q_604": "OK. OK. Um, OK so Rob, is there anything that you wanted to tell me that I haven't asked you already today?",
    "q_605": "Um, I mean, it's hard to tell right now what it is. It sounds like it's it started pretty suddenly, um, like it started a day ago, correct?",
    "q_606": "Yeah, so it's unlikely that cancer would present itself like this so acutely, you know?",
    "q_607": " And, but it could it could be a number of things like, it could be something like a pulmonary embolism, but you said you don't have any swelling. Um, but you did say you have some chest pain when you're breathing pretty, when you take a deep breath in. So I mean, that's a possibility. It doesn't sound like it's an infection because you don't have a fever or chills or any any other symptom really. And you mentioned there weren't any triggers like no trauma to the area. And then, other things could be like COPD because you which is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because you have been smoking since college and that's basically just inflammation in your lungs that causes your airways to narrow, and so you may have a hard time breathing. So for all of these things, we first start by doing some blood work and then we'll do some imaging like a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test if indicated, and so that will give us a better idea of what you have and how we can best help you. Sounds good?",
    "q_608": "OK, when did it start?",

    "q_675": "OK alright well those are all the questions I had for you. If you didn't have anything else to add, I guess we will conclude by saying that what you have, we have a differential diagnosis for this. Um, it sounds like what you have is asthma. Since your symptoms started three months ago when you moved into a flat with your friends, and it seems like this smoking and cold is triggering that and so we'll work you up with a pulmonary function test to start and we'll see if bronchodilators will help with your symptoms. And if it doesn't, we'll also rule out other things like pneumonia or like allergic rhinitis. How does that sound?",
    "q_676": "OK, um so the breathlessness started six weeks ago, correct?",

    "q_683": "OK, sure. And are there things that make make it better or worse?",
    "q_684": "OK, um, and was there any sort of trigger six weeks ago that you think may have like caused all of your symptoms?",

    "q_725": "OK OK, so you mentioned you moved to Canada from India about a year back. Where do you live now?",
    "q_726": "OK, OK, and are they sick as well or no?",
    "q_727": "OK. And have they been to a doctor?",
    "q_728": " Have they been investigated?",
    "q_729": " Were they ever given a diagnosis?",
    "q_730": "OK, OK. Um, do you smoke?",

    "q_736": ", OK. OK, um, did you have any questions or concerns?",
    "q_737": " Anything you wanted to discuss that I hadn't asked you about?",
    "q_738": "Yeah, for sure. So the first thing we want to rule out is TB. Because you have recently moved to Canada from a country where it is, I believe it is endemic, so and some of your most of your symptoms fit with TB and how it presents so we just want to make sure it's not that because it is highly infectious and and we don't want it to spread. So, we can do like a AFB smear or I think they have other diagnostic work up for that too. So we'll do that first. If not, we can check to see if it's like another, another typical pneumonia, we can do a chest X Ray for that as well. If both of those turn out to be negatives, then we'll have to work you up further for other things, like COPD, or lung cancer. How does that sound?",
    "q_739": "OK, the cough and breathlessness both started two years ago?",
    "q_740": "OK, OK. Um, do you always have the breathlessness, or does it come and go?",
    "q_741": "OK, OK, um and same thing with the cough?",

    "q_745": "OK, and, does anything make it worse or better besides the exertion?",
    "q_746": "OK, and how would you describe your breathlessness?",
    "q_747": " Is it that you're breathing too fast or you can't catch your breath?",
    "q_748": "OK, OK. Um, and out of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your breathlessness?",
    "q_749": "OK, and have you ever experienced this before?",

    "q_2090": "No, OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?",
    "q_2091": "Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a COVID swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Umm we do suggest because his symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister if possible. And then if the swap comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays. If his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms like seizures or if he's feeling weak, dizzy, if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and uhm, so for now I'll just wait for those COVID swabs to come back.

    "q_2100": "OK, and um is it getting worse, do you think?",
    "q_2101": "OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?",

    "q_2141": "And, OK, um have you traveled anywhere recently?",
    "q_2142": "No, OK. Well those were all the questions that I had for you today, was there um anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today?",
    "q_2143": "No, OK. So right now it seems like, if I'm going through my differential diagnosis list for you, at the top is, the thing that we have to rule out is Covid, so we'll take a swab and send it off for those PCR results and you'll hear back either tomorrow or the day after, about the results. But in the mean time, and I guess even if the test is negative, um and you're still having symptoms, please do isolate for 14 days. Um and if your symptoms get worse, um like you know, you're having trouble breathing, uh your fever, your temperature is off the charts, um or you're having any sort of neurological symptom, please do um go to the ER and seek out help. Um if it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around at, during this time of year, um, and usually the treatment for that kind of stuff is supportive, so make sure you're staying well hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods, uh you're getting good sleep. Um and if not, and your symptoms, you know you're having a productive cough, um you're really short of breath, uh we can test you to see if you have some sort of bacterial pneumonia, and those are usually treated with antibiotics, so that's kind of the plan right now. Um so we'll just start with that Covid swab for now. How does that sound?",
    "q_2144": "OK yeah, it's good that you've come in. Um, so the cough started four days ago, has it been constant since?",
    "q_2145": "OK, and how often are you coughing?",
    "q_2146": "Oh OK, um is it a dry cough or are you producing sputum?",
    "q_2147": "OK, so no sputum, no blood?",

    "q_2150": " Have you tried anything for this cough?",
    "q_2151": "OK, um how about, ah, OK. And if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's it's, it sounds barky, it sounds harsh, um how would you describe it?",
    "q_2152": "Harsh, OK. And if you were to rate your symptoms 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is it?",
    "q_2153": "Six, OK. And and have you found that your symptoms are getting worse, staying the same, or getting better over the past four days?",

Um so we'll take a swab today, we'll send it off um for those PCR results, you should hear back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh in the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days, and that includes from family members when possible, and public health will get in touch with you if those results are positive and so they can they can do some contact tracing. If it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around, and I guess the best therapy for that is staying hydrated, um getting good sleep, and eating nutritious foods. Uh but if your symptoms get worse, like you're running a really high fever, um you're having neurological symptoms like you know seizures or fainting spells, um or if you're having difficulty breathing, um you should come back to the ER.

Um so, and it's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we'll do a covid swab today um and you'll hear back within 24 to 48 hours, um but in the mean time, regardless of whether you actually have covid or not, because your symptoms overlap with covid, um it's good to isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from your wife as well if possible, and public health should be in touch if it's positive uh to do contact tracing. Um and if it's not covid, it's probably another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. Uh if your symptoms get worse, um you know you're having neurological symptoms or or if your fever gets really high, or you're having a lot of trouble breathing, then you should go see the ER. How does that sound?",

    "q_2392": "OK, so you haven't actually taken your temperature, but it you just feel like you have chills?",
    "q_2393": "OK, we could take your temperature today. And then the loss of smell and taste. Do they both happen at the same time?",
    "q_2394": "OK. Um alright, so let's go back to the cough and has it been constant since it started?",
    "q_2395": "OK, um so yeah, you mentioned possibly a trigger would be like time of day at night?",
    "q_2396": " Or did you notice any other triggers like you know, the cold air or dust or anything at home that could be potentially triggering your cough?",
    "q_2397": "OK, and in terms of the quality of your cough is that, would you say it's harsh?",
    "q_2398": " Barky?",
    "q_2399": "OK, OK. And then you said dry cough so no sputum or blood right?",
    "q_2400": "OK. Have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?",
    "q_2401": "OK. And then, um, have you experienced any shortness of breath?",

    "q_2411": "Any pain or discharge in the eyes or ears?",
    "q_2412": "OK. Do you ever feel like your heart's racing?",

    "q_2414": "OK, any dizziness or fainting spells?",
    "q_2415": "OK. Confusion or memory loss?",
    "q_2416": "No, no blood in the stool, right?",
    "q_2417": "OK, any changes to your appetite?",
    "q_2418": "Yeah yeah, that makes sense. Any nausea or vomiting?",
    "q_2419": "No, OK. And any changes in terms of urine?",
    "q_2420": "OK, good. Any major or a longstanding medical conditions, or are you otherwise healthy?",
    "q_2421": "Oh ok. OK. And what triggers your asthma?",

    "q_2433": "OK, have you ever thought about cutting down?",
    "q_2434": "Do you do marijuana?",
    "q_2435": "OK, how about other recreational drugs?",
    "q_2436": "OK, and then um, I guess I'll ask you about the alcohol, uhm, how much do you drink?",
    "q_2437": "OK. Uhm, and where do you live right now?",
    "q_2438": "OK and anyone else at home sick?",
    "q_2439": "Yeah, that makes sense. And have you traveled to anywhere recently?",
    "q_2440": "OK. Uhm, OK, that's good. Those were all the questions I had for you today. Was there anything that you wanted to ask me or anything else that you wanted to discuss that I may have missed?",
    "q_2441": "Yeah for sure. that's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we will be doing a COVID swab on you and and you will hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with the results. But regardless, because your symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID especially umm, the loss of smell and taste, we do recommend that you isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from family members as well. So we'll, that's where we'll start. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. But, we'll start with, we'll start with these COVID swabs. How does that sound?",
    "q_2442": "OK, when did the cough start?",

    "q_2670": "Changes in your bowel movement or abdominal pain?",
    "q_2671": "Changes to urinating?",
    "q_2672": "OK, so besides the COPD, do you have any other longstanding conditions?",
    "q_2673": "OK, and when was the last time you had your blood pressure checked?",

    "q_2693": "Yeah OK, that makes sense. Well, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?",
    "q_2694": "Yeah, so we're definitely going to do a COVID swab on you and those results should take about 24 to 48 hours to come back to you. And in the meantime, because your symptoms do overlap with COVID, you should isolate for 14 days. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive to do some contact tracing. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working. If we need to add any additional things like inhaled corticosteroids as well as antibiotics and so just keep an eye on your symptoms for now and will also want to do probably a chest X Ray and possibly a pulmonary function test. How does that sound?",
    "q_2695": "OK, so you said the cough started a week ago?",
    "q_2696": "Ok, have you taken your temperature?",
    "q_2697": " You said you haven't taken your temperature right?",
    "q_2698": "OK. So let's focus on the cough. Is it persistent or does it come and go?",
    "q_2699": "OK, and does it get worse with like cold air or dust?",
    "q_2700": " Like maybe pets or anything like that?",
    "q_2701": "OK, umm, does it get better with anything?",
    "q_2702": " Have you tried any over the counter cough syrup?",
    "q_2703": "OK, and how would you describe this cough?",
    "q_2704": " Is it barky?",
    "q_2705": " Is it harsh?",
    "q_2706": " Does it sound muffled?",
    "q_2707": "OK, um, what color is the sputum?",
    "q_2708": "OK, is it ever green or do you ever see blood in there?",
    "q_2709": "OK. And have you ever had a cough like this before?",
    "q_2710": "OK, do you have a sore throat?",
    "q_2711": "Is this cough getting worse?",
    "q_2712": "OK, good. Any changes in your taste or smell?",
    "q_2713": "OK, any changes in hearing or vision?",
    "q_2714": "And did you have in the past week a runny or stuffy nose?",
    "q_2715": "OK, any weight loss over the past month?",
    "q_2716": "How about changes in your hair, nails or skin like rashes?",
    "q_2717": "OK, any shortness of breath?",
    "q_2718": "How about wheezing?",
    "q_2719": "K, chest pain?",
    "q_2720": "How about swelling?",
    "q_2721": " Have you noticed any swelling in like your legs or arms or your belly area?",
    "q_2722": "OK, how about you feeling like your heart's racing?",
    "q_2723": "OK, how about a calf pain?",
    "q_2724": "Any dizziness or fainting spells?",
    "q_2725": "Headaches?",
    "q_2726": "Confusion or memory loss?",
    "q_2727": "Have your bowel movements been normal?",
    "q_2728": "OK, how about urinating wise?",
    "q_2729": "OK,nausea or vomiting?",
    "q_2730": "Joint pain or muscle ache?",
    "q_2731": "OK. Any Contacts with sick people around you recently?",
    "q_2732": "OK, did she get it checked out in a clinic?",
    "q_2733": "OK, any travel recently?",
    "q_2734": "Are you otherwise healthy?",
    "q_2735": " Do you have any longstanding medical conditions?",
    "q_2736": "OK. OK, no hospitalizations other than that too, right?",
    "q_2737": "Are you on any medications?",
    "q_2738": "OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?",
    "q_2739": "OK, how about allergies?",
    "q_2740": "OK. And any family history of lung conditions?",
    "q_2741": "How about heart conditions?",

    "q_2743": "OK. Any cancers in the family?",
    "q_2744": "OK, how old was she when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer?",
    "q_2745": "OK, and do you smoke?",
    "q_2746": "How about marijuana?",
    "q_2747": "OK, sure and by joint, you said once a month right?",
    "q_2748": "OK, any other drugs?",
    "q_2749": "And where do you live right now?",
    "q_2750": "OK, any reasons to think you have old carpet mold or asbestos?",
    "q_2751": "OK, and well those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions for me?",
    "q_2752": "Are you concerned about that?",
    "q_2753": "Honestly, some of your symptoms do seem to be overlapping with that of COVID, especially the cough and fever. So we are going to do a COVID swab just to rule that out. So you will get those results in 24 to 48 hours and you should isolate for 14 days because your symptoms overlap. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive just to do some contact tracing. But if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year so keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse, or if you're experiencing symptoms like neurological deficits or weakness or seizures or anything like that, get help from the ER right away and if your symptoms are persisting beyond like seven days to 10 days, also you should give us a call back to see what's going on because it could be something like a bacterial infection, in which case we can give you some antibiotics. Does that sound OK?",
    "q_2754": "Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. When did this start?",
    "q_2755": "OK, well let's focus on the shortness of breath first and then we'll talk about your cough as well. So you noticed that you had difficulties with breathing sometime within the past three days. When do you find that it's difficult for you to breathe?",
    "q_2756": " Is there anything that makes breathing more difficult for you?",
    "q_2757": "So say walking up the stairs or doing any exercise doesn't make it worse?",
    "q_2758": "OK, so there's really no relationship with activity with your shortness of breath. OK, and I can see that you're able to sort of talk in full sentences.  OK, how is it making it difficult for you to do things at home, your difficulty breathing?",
    "q_2759": "OK, and your cough, you said that started three days ago. Is it a dry cough or wet cough?",
    "q_2760": "OK, and there's no sputum production with it?",
    "q_2761": " Anything coming up at all?",
    "q_2762": "OK, and is there anything that's making the cough better?",
    "q_2763": " Did you take anything?",
    "q_2764": " Any medications for it?",
    "q_2765": "OK alright. Other than the difficulty breathing and the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?",
    "q_2766": "OK. Can you tell me a bit more about your headache?",
    "q_2767": "Have you had a headache like this before?",
    "q_2768": "Have you taken anything for your headache?",
    "q_2769": " Any pain meds?",
    "q_2770": "And so you talked about being tired, having a headache, difficulties breathing, and coughing over the past three days. Have any of these symptoms gotten worse overtime?",
    "q_2771": "OK, and have you had any chills or have you checked your temperature?",
    "q_2772": "We can check your temperature here. And have you had any muscle aches?",
    "q_2773": "Any redness in the eyes?",
    "q_2774": " Or any runny nose or sore throat like flu-like symptoms?",
    "q_2775": "OK. And have you had any change in your sense of smell?",
    "q_2776": "What about your sense of taste?",
    "q_2777": " Are you able to taste things?",
    "q_2778": "Have you noticed any rash anywhere on your body?",
    "q_2779": "OK, any changes in your bowel movement, diarrhea or constipation?",
    "q_2780": "Any chest pain?",
    "q_2781": "OK. Alright, well it sounds like you have multiple symptoms right now that started about 3 days ago. You're feeling tired, you have a headache, difficulties breathing, some muscle aches and you've been feeling feverish. You've also had this cough, and your nose is feeling congested. Is there anything else that that you've been experiencing over the past three days that I haven't talked about yet?",
    "q_2782": "OK, umm, alright, can you tell me about your past medical history?",
    "q_2783": " Do you have any medical conditions?",
    "q_2784": "Umm, does the shortness of breath that you're experiencing feel similar to the asthma attacks in any way?",
    "q_2785": "Do you have an inhaler?",
    "q_2786": "I see, did you use it over the past three days at all?",
    "q_2787": "Uh, and other than that, have you had any any surgeries in the past?",
    "q_2788": "Any reason for that?",
    "q_2789": "I see OK, and any hospitalizations?",
    "q_2790": "OK. Do you take any medications?",
    "q_2791": " I know you have puffers. Any medications, including over the counter pills?",
    "q_2792": "And, uh, any allergies to food, medications, or environmental allergies?",
    "q_2793": "In terms of family histories, you did mention that your dad had colon cancer. Any other medical problems that that run in your family?",
    "q_2794": "OK. And do you currently smoke?",
    "q_2795": "OK, what about marijuana?",
    "q_2796": "OK, do you or have you ever had alcohol?",
    "q_2797": "OK, sounds good and have you ever had any street drugs?",
    "q_2798": "Alright, sounds good, and have you had any contact with any sick people?",
    "q_2799": " Anyone who's sick recently?",
    "q_2800": "What about any other travels or any travels at all outside the city or the country recently?",
    "q_2801": "Alright. So I guess that's all I wanted to know. I'll go talk to the attending and we'll come back and do a physical exam and maybe ask a couple more questions and then discuss the management with you. Does that sound good to you?",
    "q_2802": "I'm well thanks. What brings you in today?",
    "q_2803": "OK, when you say the past couple of days, do you mean two days, three days, four days?",
    "q_2804": "OK, so loss of taste, so you can't taste anything or you can only taste some things or you're just not getting the full depth of your taste?",
    "q_2805": "Yeah, OK. Umm, did you have any trauma to the area like the mouth area or the nose area in the past couple of days or days leading up to that?",

    "q_2861": "OK, good, umm alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns that you wanted to bring up?",
    "q_2862": "Yeah, you know, that's probably top on my list of things to investigate you for, so I would say COVID or other viral illnesses that could be going around this time of year. That would have less of a similar presentation, and so we will do a COVID swab for you. And in the meantime, if you could isolate for 14 days, regardless of whether the swab comes back positive or negative, and that would be great. If the swab comes back positive, we will notify public health and they'll try to trace where you could have caught this from and if it turns out it's not a viral illness, we will try to work you up for any bacterial infections which can be treated with antibiotics. So that's where we will start, does that sound good?",

    "q_2886": "No, OK. Um, how about muscle aches or pains?",
    "q_2887": "Did that start around the same time that you experienced your cough and possible fever?",
    "q_2888": "OK, any dizziness?",
    "q_2889": "Any confusion or memory loss?",
    "q_2890": "OK, any fainting spells?",
    "q_2891": "Any rashes?",
    "q_2892": "OK, so it's your cough and just in general how you feel. Does it get better or worse with anything?",
    "q_2893": " Have you tried you know Tylenol and any antipyretics?",
    "q_2894": "OK, yeah. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?",
    "q_2895": "OK. Umm, and then since you started having this cough too, now has anything changed?",
    "q_2896": " How are you feeling worse?",
    "q_2897": " Or do you feel kind of the same as when it started?",
    "q_2898": "OK, and has anyone around you been sick recently?",
    "q_2899": "OK, have you traveled anywhere recently?",
    "q_2900": "OK, and they're fine?",
    "q_2901": " No one is sick?",
    "q_2902": "OK, and are you otherwise healthy?",
    "q_2903": " Do you have any medical conditions?",
    "q_2904": "Sure, OK. No surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?",
    "q_2905": "OK and no other medications?",
    "q_2906": "Ok, and no other you know over the counter medications or herbal stuff?",
    "q_2907": "OK. And so you said seasonal allergies. Any other allergies?",
    "q_2908": "OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?",
    "q_2909": "OK good. And in terms of family history, do any of your family members have lung conditions or heart conditions?",
    "q_2910": "OK, any cancers that run in the family?",
    "q_2911": "OK, and then do you smoke?",
    "q_2912": "OK, how much do you smoke?",
    "q_2913": "Did you say a joint on the weekends?",
    "q_2914": "OK, so is that like 1 milligram?",
    "q_2915": "OK. But no cigarettes though?",
    "q_2916": "OK, any other recreational drugs?",
    "q_2917": "OK, and do you drink alcohol?",
    "q_2918": "Sure. And and where do you live?",
    "q_2919": "Sure, is it an apartment complex or is it like a full house?",
    "q_2920": "OK, um any concerns with your living arrangements you know, like old carpets or anything like that?",
    "q_2921": "OK good good. Did you have any other questions or concerns?",
    "q_2922": " Anything that you wanted to bring up that I didn't touch on today?",
    "q_2923": "Yeah, for sure, and I think that's a valid concern. So right now I'm just going through, you know, a list of differential diagnoses that you could possibly have and COVID, it's definitely top on my list and so we will likely get a swab and run those tests and try to get that back to you as soon as we can. It could also be other respiratory infections, especially viral infections this time of the year. And so, if it comes back negative for COVID, it's probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu. So we'll go from there. And if it turns out it's not a viral infection, we will likely see if it's some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those. But it definitely sounds like there's an infectious picture going on here because of the acuteness of the presentation, and just your symptoms. So we will do afollow up in a week or so. Until then, we will run all these labs. Does that sound good?",
    "q_2924": "OK, and the fever started four days ago as well?",
    "q_2925": "OK, so that's definitely a fever, so we can take your temperature today as well. Umm, so have your symptoms been the same or getting worse, or be getting better over the past few days?",
    "q_2926": "OK, have you ever felt like this before?",
    "q_2927": "OK. And do you have a sore throat at all?",
    "q_2928": "OK, and do you have any issues swallowing food?",
    "q_2929": "OK, you haven't been as hungry. Um, have you had any changes to your taste?",
    "q_2930": "OK, how about smell?",
    "q_2931": "OK, do you have a runny nose or a blocked nose?",
    "q_2932": " Do you feel congested?",
    "q_2933": "OK, how about your hearing or vision?",
    "q_2934": " Any changes there?",
    "q_2935": "OK, any pain or discharge from either your ears or eyes?",
    "q_2936": "OK, so let's go back to the cough. Um, are you producing any sputum?",
    "q_2937": "OK, so it's a dry cough?",
    "q_2938": "OK, any blood associated with the cough?",
    "q_2939": "OK, do you feel wheezy at all?",
    "q_2940": "OK, how about shortness of breath?",
    "q_2941": "OK, any chest pain?",
    "q_2942": "Do you ever feel like your heart's racing?",
    "q_2943": "OK, and any night sweats or chills?",
    "q_2944": "OK, and how about weight loss?",
    "q_2945": " Have you had any weight loss over the past few months?",
    "q_2946": "OK, yeah. Umm, does anything make the cough better or worse?",
    "q_2947": "OK, and how have your bowel movements been?",
    "q_2948": "OK, and any abdominal pain?",
    "q_2949": "Nauseous, OK. Have you thrown up?",
    "q_2950": "OK, and any triggers for your nausea?",
    "q_2951": "OK, when when did your headache start?",
    "q_2952": "OK yeah, you said past several days, have you ever had headaches before that?",
    "q_2953": "OK. Do these headaches feel like the same headaches?",
    "q_2954": "OK, so it's not like the worst headache you've ever experienced?",
    "q_2955": "OK, yeah. Do you feel fatigued or tired at all?",
    "q_2956": "Yeah, umm, and do you feel any sort of body aches that go along with your fatigue?",
    "q_2957": "OK. Umm, can you think of anything that may have caused your symptoms?",
    "q_2958": " You know, have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?",
    "q_2959": "OK, and you were wearing your mask?",
    "q_2960": " Everyone else was wearing their mask?",
    "q_2961": "OK, have you traveled anywhere recently?",

    "q_2967": "OK, and that's when you were told you were pre-diabetic?",
    "q_2968": "OK, yeah, that's understandable. Um, have you made any sort of lifestyle changes to get your blood glucose under control?",
    "q_2969": "OK, sounds good. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?",
    "q_2970": "And are you on any medications?",
    "q_2971": "OK, and any over the counter medications or herbal supplements?",
    "q_2972": "OK, umm, do you have any allergies?",
    "q_2973": "OK, and did you need to be treated with any sort of antibiotics recently?",
    "q_2974": "OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?",
    "q_2975": "OK, good. An yeah, that's really good. Um, do you know if you have any family history of any lung conditions or heart conditions?",
    "q_2976": "OK, how about cancers in the family?",
    "q_2977": "OK, and I forget if I asked you earlier, but have you had any changes to your urinary habits, any changes in your urine itself or voiding frequency?",
    "q_2978": "OK, great. And do you smoke?",

    "q_2984": "OK. I think those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we end the interview?",
    "q_2985": "OK, I'm sorry to hear that. Um, when you say last few days, did you mean the past two days?",
    "q_2986": " 3 days?",
    "q_2987": "OK, when you say you haven't been feeling good for the past five days, is it that you feel achy?",
    "q_2988": " Do you feel hot like you have a fever, or do you feel weak?",
    "q_2989": "Tired?",
    "q_2990": " OK. And nausea and vomiting. Are you throwing up or just feeling nauseous?",

    "q_3013": "OK, any rashes?",
    "q_3014": "OK, how about headaches?",
    "q_3015": "Right, OK. It hasn't been intense you said?",
    "q_3016": " So have you had headaches like this in the past?",
    "q_3017": "Yeah, that's understandable. But it's not like the worst headache you've ever had?",
    "q_3018": "OK, OK, good, and are you otherwise healthy?",
    "q_3019": "K, OK, good. It's good that you're on both of those. Do you take any other medications like over the counter medications or herbal supplements?",
    "q_3020": "Yeah, it's a great idea to take that, especially as we get older and if we live in a country where we don't get a lot of sun exposure like Canada, so that's good. And sorry before I move on, I forgot to ask you earlier if you have experienced any weight loss or night sweats recently?",
    "q_3021": "OK, and did you take your temperature?",
    "q_3022": "Yeah, OK. Alright, so I'll go back to your past medical history. Have you been hospitalized or have you ever needed surgeries in the past?",
    "q_3023": "OK, that's good. Um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?",
    "q_3024": "Oh great, OK, that's awesome and are you allergic to anything?",
    "q_3025": "Peanuts, OK. Do you know if you have a family history of any lung or heart conditions?",
    "q_3026": "OK, how about any stomach problems or liver problems?",
    "q_3027": " Colon problems?",
    "q_3028": "OK, yeah, that's a good idea. Um, so it sounds like you're, you know, preemptive with your health, which is good. Any other cancers that run in the family?",
    "q_3029": "OK. And do you smoke at all?",
    "q_3030": "K, how about marijuana?",
    "q_3031": "OK, how about other recreational drugs?",

    "q_3038": "OK, and do you live in a house or an apartment?",
    "q_3039": "On the 8th floor, OK, any issues in terms of like old carpet or mold or asbestos in the apartment?",
    "q_3040": "OK good. That's good. So those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we ended the interview?",
    "q_3041": "Yeah for sure. So you know, right now we're thinking it could be a viral GI viral infection because of your complaints of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and fever. But it could also be COVID and we are going to have to do a swab for you and run that test because you have a lot of symptoms that overlap with those symptoms. Um, and then, so just going off of that, we'll wait for the swabs to come back. If they come back positive, we will notify public health and they'll do a trace to see where you could have gotten this infection from. And then meanwhile, we do suggest that you isolate for two weeks so that you don't spread the illness, and even if the swab comes back negative, there is still a chance that you may have COVID and it's a false negative test. So we'll start there. If it turns out you don't have any of those viral illnesses and you have more of a, you know, bacterial picture, we can work you up for that and prescribe antibiotics. So that's where we will start. How does that sound?",
    "q_3042": "OK, um, when did the cough start?",
    "q_3043": "Three days ago, OK, and uh, around that time did you also start feeling short of breath?",
    "q_3044": "OK, and the cough, is it a dry cough or is it a wet cough?",
    "q_3045": "OK, any blood in the sputum?",
    "q_3046": "OK, and how much sputum are you coughing up each time?",
    "q_3047": " Like is it kind of the size of your fingertip or does it fill your whole palm?",
    "q_3048": "OK, OK um, and do you notice any, like pus or froth in the sputum?",
    "q_3049": "OK, and if you were to describe the sound of your cough, does it sound like it's barky or like a hacking cough?",
    "q_3050": "Alright, and do you hear any wheezing at all?",
    "q_3051": "OK, and the shortness of breath, how severe is it?",
    "q_3052": " 1 to 10, 10 being the worst?",
    "q_3053": "At seven OK, are you having issues sleeping because of your shortness of breath?",
    "q_3054": "OK, and do you find there are any triggers to your coughing like like um, a particular time of the day?",
    "q_3055": " Triggers like you know pollen or things in your environment like pets?",
    "q_3056": "OK yeah, um yeah, that doesn't sound great in terms of your shortness of breath. Do you find that certain positions make it worse?",
    "q_3057": " Or like exerting yourself makes it worse?",
    "q_3058": "OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?",
    "q_3059": "OK. And any other symptoms that you have along with your coughing and sputum?",
    "q_3060": "OK yeah um, along with your fatigue and feeling weak, have you experienced any dizziness or fainting spells?",
    "q_3061": "OK, any confusion or memory loss?",
    "q_3062": "OK. And how about um, muscle aches or any sort of body aches?",
    "q_3063": "Yeah, alright, so let's go back to your shortness of breath. Do you have any chest pain associated with that?",
    "q_3064": "OK, and do you ever feel like your heart's racing?",
    "q_3065": "OK, and how about changes to your bowel movements?",
    "q_3066": "OK and no blood in your stool?",
    "q_3067": "OK, how about abdominal pains?",
    "q_3068": "OK, and how about a sore throat?",
    "q_3069": "OK, good and have you experienced any loss of taste?",
    "q_3070": "Your smell has been kind of funny, like you can't smell or do things smell differently than you expect them to?",
    "q_3071": "Ok, do you have a runny nose or a blocked nose?",
    "q_3072": "OK, any changes in your vision or hearing?",
    "q_3073": "OK, any discharge or pain in your eyes or ears?",
    "q_3074": "OK, and then any changes to your urine?",

    "q_3076": " Do you have any medical conditions?",
    "q_3077": "OK, how long have you had A. fib?",
    "q_3078": "OK, four years, and when was the last time you had an ECG?",
    "q_3079": "OK, and the last time that it was done, was it normal?",
    "q_3080": "OK, good. And then have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?",
    "q_3081": "OK, any complications from that?",
    "q_3082": "OK, and then besides the Metoprolol, are you on any other medications?",
    "q_3083": "OK, and is that for the A. fib as well, the aspirin?",
    "q_3084": " Or is that just for other cardiovascular issues or some sort of preventative measure?",
    "q_3085": "OK. and let's revisit your medications at the end of today's session. I just want to make sure that you're on the medications and I just want to make sure you're on the right dose.  Does that sound good?",
    "q_3086": "OK, OK and have you had any reason to suspect that you may have taken any sulfas recently?",
    "q_3087": "OK, OK, good and are you up to date with all your immunizations?",
    "q_3088": "OK, good, good yeah, those two we definitely recommend if you're over 65. OK, and do you know of any family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?",
    "q_3089": "OK, OK and how about other cancers?",
    "q_3090": "And have you been in touch or do you think you've been in contact with any anyone sick recently?",
    "q_3091": "OK, and have there been any COVID outbreaks at the long term care?",
    "q_3092": "OK, OK and any travel history?",
    "q_3093": "And do you smoke?",
    "q_3094": "OK, OK, well that's good. Good for you for quitting. How about marijuana?",
    "q_3095": "The CBD stuff OK. And how many milligrams?",
    "q_3096": "OK good. Is there a particular reason you take these CBD edibles?",
    "q_3097": "OK, that sounds good and do you do any other recreational drugs?",
    "q_3098": "OK, how about alcohol?",
    "q_3099": "OK, and did you used to drink before?",
    "q_3100": "OK, and what's your living situation like right now?",
    "q_3101": "In a house, OK. Any concerns for like old carpets, mold or asbestos in your house?",
    "q_3102": "OK, good and I apologize, but I would like to clarify three more symptoms with you. Did you say you felt like you had a fever earlier?",
    "q_3103": "OK, well we can take a temperature today just to make sure. Have you been feeling like you have night sweats or chills?",
    "q_3104": "OK, and how about, um, any weight loss over the past few months?",
    "q_3105": "OK, alright good, so that brings us to the end. Do you have any questions or concerns that you would like to clarify before we end the interview?",
    "q_3106": "Yeah, you know, um, right now it looks like, it sounds like it could be an upper respiratory viral illness, so that includes COVID.  So we will do a swab for you and then send it off to the lab for PCR results. In the meantime, because you have symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, we do encourage isolation for 14 days. Until your symptoms are gone, sorry,  until your symptoms are gone, even if they're gone, we do suggest isolating for 14 days just to make sure you're not a carrier or could spread COVID so we do encourage that, and that includes from your husband. If possible, we will get those results in a day or two. If they are positive, we will send your results to public health who will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten it from. If it's not COVID, it could be other viral illnesses that are going around this time of year. And if your symptoms aren't getting better on their own, and there's reason to suspect you may have a bacterial infection or bacterial pneumonia, we will follow up with you and possibly prescribe antibiotics. How does that sound?",
    "q_3107": "OK, alright so the sore throat started 5 days ago and then the fever started when?",
    "q_3108": "Three days ago, OK, and the muscle aches started two days ago?",
    "q_3109": "Three days ago, OK. OK, are you having any trouble swallowing foods or fluids?",
    "q_3110": "OK. And is it hard for you to like, are you having issues vocalising at all?",
    "q_3111": "OK, OK and then, are you having any issues with taste or smell?",
    "q_3112": "OK, how about hearing or vision?",
    "q_3113": "Any weight loss over the past few weeks?",
    "q_3114": "OK, any fatigue or exhaustion?",
    "q_3115": "OK, how about changes in your hair, nails or skin like rashes?",
    "q_3116": "Do you have a cough at all?",
    "q_3117": "How about shortness of breath or wheezing?",
    "q_3118": "OK chest pain or you feeling like your heart's racing?",
    "q_3119": "No, and how about dizziness or fainting spells?",
    "q_3120": "OK, how about changes to your bowel movements?",
    "q_3121": "OK, that's good. Any changes in your appetite?",
    "q_3122": "Yeah, OK. How about nausea or vomiting?",
    "q_3123": "OK, OK, and any issues with joint pain?",
    "q_3124": " You said your muscle aches, but how about joints?",
    "q_3125": "OK, OK, are you otherwise healthy?",
    "q_3126": "Yeah, OK, and do you take medication for any of these things?",
    "q_3127": "Sure yeah, are you up to date with all your immunizations?",
    "q_3128": "OK, do you know if you got a vaccine called Shingrix for shingles and Pneumovax for pneumococcal infections?",
    "q_3129": "OK, good. And and how about any allergies?",
    "q_3130": "OK, how about family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?",
    "q_3131": "OK, OK. And then any cancers in the family?",
    "q_3132": "How old was he when he was diagnosed?",
    "q_3133": "OK, well he's yeah, that's young. Have you had a colonoscopy?",
    "q_3134": "OK. Have you had any sick contacts recently?",
    "q_3135": "Yeah, OK, and you said you're retired. Do you live alone?",
    "q_3136": " Do you live with anyone?",
    "q_3137": "OK, any old carpets?",
    "q_3138": " Mold, dust, asbestos?",
    "q_3139": "OK, good, and do you smoke?",
    "q_3140": "OK, good, good for you. How much did you smoke before you quit?",
    "q_3141": "OK, that's good, that's good that you quit. Do you drink any alcohol?",
    "q_3142": "OK, couple times a week so two to three times?",
    "q_3143": "OK, OK. And then any marijuana?",
    "q_3144": "OK, good, well those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?",
    "q_3145": "Yeah, for sure. I think just because your symptoms do overlap with those of COVID, we will be doing a COVID swab today and you should hear back about your results in 24 to 48 hours. But you should still self-isolate for 14 days because you do have similar symptoms and if it's not COVID, it's probably another viral illness that's going around these days and for that you don't need any medication, like prescribed medications, but just keep an eye on that, on your symptoms. Stay hydrated, eat well. If you need to lower your feve, you can use Tylenol. And if your symptoms worsen or you start getting neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?",

    "q_3186": "Okay, well, I think those are all the questions that I had for him. Anything that you wanted to add or anything that I missed today?",
    "q_3187": "Yeah, so he does seem to be checking off some of the criteria for strep throat. So just to make sure, because he does have a score of right now at least three or four, or maybe even five, definitely over four, we can prescribe him some antibiotics. But we will do a rapid strep test first in the clinic here today just to rule out in or rule that out. If it comes back positive and I guess even if it isn't positive because he checked off a lot of the boxes for strep throat, we will give him a prescription for penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days. And then you can take that if his symptoms don't go away in a day or two. Because his symptoms also overlap with COVID, we will. do a swab for that as well and you should hear back within 24 to 48 hours and then you should isolate for 14 days. Does that sound good?",

    "q_3233": "So are your symptoms similar to when you got admitted?",
    "q_3234": "OK, worse, OK, so you're having a cough, shortness of breath and fever, and did that all start together?",

    "q_3281": " Any other questions that you have for me today?",
    "q_3282": "Yeah, so there's definitely multiple things that can be going on. Since you were just recently admitted, maybe you might have another bacterial r espiratory infection, like a pneumonia or it could be viral as well. So the first thing we want to do is for sure get COVID swab done and then we will also get, since you were admitted, as well recently, we want to get an X Ray on you just to see if there's any pneumonia. OK, and so we'll be keeping you here for a bit until everything comes back. We'll get some blood work done for you as well to see if there's any infection in your body. And then yeah, so just sit tight, we'll get all those things done. Is that OK with you?",
    "q_3283": "OK, and when did she start getting short of breath?",
    "q_3284": "Has her fever been getting worse or has it stayed around the same?",
    "q_3285": "OK, and when did the trouble swallowing start?",
    "q_3286": "OK, and has it been getting worse at all?",
    "q_3287": "OK, so it's both solids and fluids. OK, have you noticed any swelling in her neck area or redness or swelling in her throat?",
    "q_3288": "OK, you see a lot of redness in there?",
    "q_3289": "And has she been drooling at all?",
    "q_3290": "OK. Alright, any coughing?",
    "q_3291": "No coughing. OK, and do you notice that she's increasingly fatigued, or just not herself?",
    "q_3292": " Or is she irritable?",

    "q_3306": "OK, and any family history of any medical conditions?",
    "q_3307": "And currently, who does she live with at home?",
    "q_3308": "Because she has not been vaccinated with the H.flu vaccine and some of the symptoms that she's displaying like the drooling and trouble swallowing and now especially the shortness of breath are very concerning, I really think we should go to the Emergency Department. I'll give them a call to le them know that you're coming. Yeah, and what they will most likely do there is get a test done to see if she has H. flu and also they might do perhaps like a COVID swab as well. They might get an X Ray of her neck as well to see it. So what I think might be going on is with H. flu you can get swelling of your epiglottis and it can kind of obstruct your throat. It's very urgent matter, so that's why we will make sure you get to the ER and, uh, you know, we'll go from there. Does that sound?",
    "q_3309": " I know it may be very worrying right now. Do you have any questions at all?",
    "q_3310": "OK, so just to kind of get a timeline, what kind of started first?",
    "q_3311": "OK. And have you had any of these symptoms before?",
    "q_3312": "OK. Alright, have you noticed...so you said like the discharge is yellow, how much of the discharge are you having like in a day?",
    "q_3313": "OK, and have you been having any fevers or chills?",
    "q_3314": "OK. And did you recover from it, like on your own?",
    "q_3315": "OK, so it was just, you just had some cold-like symptoms?",
    "q_3316": "OK, alright, have you been coughing at all?",
    "q_3317": "OK, any sore throat?",
    "q_3318": "Any trouble breathing?",
    "q_3319": "Any loss of sense of taste or smell?",
    "q_3320": "OK, and did that come after the congestion or was it present before?",
    "q_3321": "OK, and would you say you're still pretty congested?",
    "q_3322": "OK. And has it been getting worse would you say?",
    "q_3323": " Or do you feel that it's getting better?",
    "q_3324": "OK, and right now what would you say is the most troubling symptom for you?",
    "q_3325": " Is it that pressure in your face or is it the congestion?",
    "q_3326": "Yeah, have you tried any medications, over the counter medications at all?",
    "q_3327": "OK. And so you've tried nasal sprays?",
    "q_3328": " Have you tried any of those, like nasal rinses, or anything like that?",
    "q_3329": "I see, OK. Any recent contact with anyone who's been ill or any recent travel?",
    "q_3330": "OK, any nausea or vomiting?",
    "q_3331": "Any fevers or chills?",
    "q_3332": "Any fatigue?",
    "q_3333": "OK, and how many days would you say you've been feeling tired for?",
    "q_3334": "OK, and do you feel that, you know you're having some discharge, but do you feel that there is mucous building up and dripping down your throat or anything like that?",
    "q_3335": "OK, and have you noticed at all or has someone told you that your breath might smell bad?",
    "q_3336": " Or have you noticed it yourself?",
    "q_3337": "OK yeah, sometimes with like mucous buildup it can affect like your breath as well. So yeah, just wondering. Any chest pain at all?",
    "q_3338": "Constipation or diarrhea?",
    "q_3339": "Any issues with urinating?",
    "q_3340": "Any changes in your sleep or appetite?",
    "q_3341": "OK, is there anything that helps you at all that you've tried?",
    "q_3342": "OK, so this has been going on for, just remind me again, like the last four day?",
    "q_3343": "OK. Do you have any other medical conditions at all that you've been diagnosed with in the past?",

    "q_3352": "OK. And do you currently smoke cigarettes?",
    "q_3353": "Do you drink alcohol?",
    "q_3354": "Any recreational drugs like marijuana?",
    "q_3355": "Ok, a joint or two, OK. And is that, is that just recreationally or has it been helping at all with your symptoms?",
    "q_3356": "OK. Alright, yeah, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all for me?",
    "q_3357": "Yeah, so from the symptoms that you're describing, it does seem more like sinus issues. There's a sinus behind your face and what can happen is if you get an infection, like all the the mucous and everything can build up and increase the pressure. That's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face.  It's because of a sinus infection most likely. And usually like, it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses, and then some oral decongestents. Or have you tried any anti histamines?",
    "q_3358": "So it's only been three day since you're having these symptoms, right?",
    "q_3359": "  And you haven't had any high fever or anything like that?",
    "q_3360": " Have you measured your temperature?",
    "q_3361": "OK, since it's been three days, what I'm going to do is still give you some antibiotics so Amoxicillin and then we'll see like after you finish that dose how you feel. And will set up another appointment for when we can do like a phone appointment and or clinic appointment when your doses are done. Does that sound good?",
    "q_3362": "Certainly, when did the, the sore throat start?",
    "q_3363": "And uhm, have you had any, uhm, problems with swallowing, like food or liquids?",
    "q_3364": "OK, uh, any like, changes that, uhm, other symptoms that you've been having with the sore throat?",

He could have anything from bronchiolitis to pneumonia so what we'll do is, we'll, first get his temperature, we'll get his O2 sat and we will get some imaging done as well to see if it's more in line with bronchiolitis or pneumonia. If it's bronchiolitis, it will be supportive treatment so we can keep him here at the hospital because he is in some distress and we'll keep him hydrated and give him some oxygen. And if it's pneumonia, we'll prescribe him some antibiotics. How does that sound?",

    "q_4192": "OK, good. So those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?",
    "q_4193": "As well as an inhaled cortico steroid. So, actually, you know what, we'll give you an inhaled cortico steroid and a short acting beta agonist because you can't use both the steroid and the long, so we'll start with those two. We'll start with the short acting as well as inhaled cortico steroid. And if we find that your asthma is just based on like, exertion or like something called athletic asthma, we can also try something called Cromolyn instead but we'll discuss that more. Right now our priority is to get your symptoms under control, so we'll start with the short acting as well as the inhaled cortico steroid. How does that sound?",
    "q_4194": "Yeah OK, so, how long did you say he's had this ear pain?",
    "q_4195": "Four days, OK. Have you noticed any hearing loss?",

    "q_4198": "Just his right ear, OK. And have you noticed that it's like, swollen, red or warm?",
    "q_4199": "OK, OK, good, and have you taken a look inside his ears?",
    "q_4200": "OK, yeah, that's fair. And you mentioned he's had a runny nose too, When did that start?",
    "q_4201": "OK. Any fevers?",

    "q_4236": "OK, no complications during your pregnancy with him, no complications during the actual delivery and then when he was a newborn?",
    "q_4237": "OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?",
    "q_4238": "Yeah, uhm so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins,  we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics. How does that sound?",
    "q_4239": "OK, and when did this start?",
    "q_4240": "OK, and so how many days has she had the hoarse voice for?",
    "q_4241": "Two or three days, OK. And when she was coughing, you mentioned like previously was she coughing up any sputum or was it more of a dry cough?",
    "q_4242": "And the cough has pretty much resolved by now?",
    "q_4243": "OK, and when she was coughing, did she at all bring up any kind of blood or any green or yellowish material?",
    "q_4244": "No, OK. Did she have any fevers at all, recently?",
    "q_4245": "OK. And does she have any kind of, uh, along with a hoarse voice, does she have any pain with talking?",
    "q_4246": "OK, and does she have any pain with swallowing any foods or liquids?",
    "q_4247": "OK, So how long has she, so she has a sore throat, how long has she had that for?",
    "q_4248": "OK, and was there anything that, so she had kind of like a cough previously, but anything else, anyone sick around her, or anything you think might have precipitated some of her symptoms?",

    "q_4287": "Yeah, so it seems like that the hoarseness of voice and the sore throat and her symptoms mostly align with what's called laryngitis, and this is usually caused by like just a viral respiratory infection. The hoarseness of voice will usually last more than a week and up to like ten days and it should resolve on its own. But we'll definitely take a better look and do a proper physical examination, see if I see any kind of swelling, redness, or any like white streaks or exudates around her pharynx as well. So after we take a look, we'll see what we can do. It doesn't seem like, it can also be a bacterial infection, in which case we would need to give her antibiotics, but usually it's a viral infection that should go away on its own. So we would just kind of wait and see and potentially just give her voice some rest during this period, and just go on from there. Do you have any other questions or concerns?",

So we'll do some of those things right now for you to kind of help you right now, as well as do some of those tests that I mentioned. Depending on what comes back, you might require an admission to the hospital just because we want to make sure you don't go home with an exacerbation, especially with the CHF as well, we need to, we will need to get that under control because that can get worse with your COPD exacerbation as well. So we need to make sure some of that, swelling goes down, if we need to adjust your medications while you're here. So yeah, let's just, I'll get back to you, we'll do some of those testing and then see where to go from there. Is that OK?",

    "q_4357": "And were you at all, in India when, were you were you living in like close quarters like in a smaller space with other people at all?",
    "q_4358": "OK, and is it like a constant cough?",
    "q_4359": " Or does it come and go?",
    "q_4360": "OK, and have you had this happen before at all?",
    "q_4361": "OK. Right, is there anything that makes your symptoms better or worse?",

    "q_4425": "OK. And yeah, those are pretty much all the questions I have right now. Do you have any questions?",
    "q_4426": "Yeah, so it seems like it's been going on for more than one and a half week. What, what is reassuring is that you're not having any other symptoms that are concerning, like you're not having any cough, you're not having any green or yellow sputum, you're not having any fevers, so it seems that you might just be having a cold, which can be caused by just a viral, uh, infection, but it should go away on its own. Just make sure that you're getting some rest, you're hydrating well, uhm, you can get some over the counter medications like Tylenol cold for example, but for now I would say we should just wait and watch. But just in case, also, since it is one of the symptoms that's for covid as well, in this time period we will just get a covid swab just in case, but most likely it's nothing to be worried about. Until you get your test, I would recommend staying isolated. And then we can go on from there, is that, does that sound good to you?",
    "q_4427": "Uhm, oK, can you tell me a little bit more about this cough?",
    "q_4428": " Is it dry or wet?",

    "q_4430": "Uhm, and have you had any blood that came up with the sputum?",
    "q_4431": "Alright, what about any other symptoms over the past two weeks?",
    "q_4432": " Have you had, have you had any fevers or chills?",
    "q_4433": "No. OK. And any uhm, I guess, any runny nose?",
    "q_4434": "OK. OK, uhm, it's just, OK last week, what else, what other symptoms did you have last week?",
    "q_4435": "So those other symptoms that you had last week that lasted about three days, are they all gone?",
    "q_4436": " are you still feeling fatigued or having a headache?",
    "q_4437": "Hmm, It's only the cough?",
    "q_4438": "Is there any time, any specific time of the day that it's worse or better?",
    "q_4439": " Anything that triggers it?",
    "q_4440": "OK, but you're otherwise feeling better?",
    "q_4441": "OK. Uhm, have you had any chest pain?",

    "q_4457": "Havey you noticed any blood?",
    "q_4458": "And it only started yesterday. What about the difficulties breathing, when did that start?",
    "q_4459": "And can you tell me if it's gotten better or worse since then?",

    "q_4469": "OK. And any pain in your belly?",
    "q_4470": "Nausea or vomiting?",
    "q_4471": "OK, and any uh diarrhea or Constipation?",
    "q_4472": "OK, any sore throat?",
    "q_4473": "OK alright uhm, any other symptoms that I haven't talked about, that you experienced over the past day?",
    "q_4474": "OK, uhm, can you tell me about your past uh, medical history, do you have any medical conditions?",
    "q_4475": "In terms of medications, are you taking any?",
    "q_4476": "OK, and uh, how well has your gerd been controlled?",
    "q_4477": "So the PPI hasn't completely curbed the, the acid reflux, you still get it?",

    "q_4479": "OK, alright. Do you have any allergies?",
    "q_4480": "OK, so you said that these symptoms started yesterday and they were quite sudden, uh, was there anything that you were doing yesterday or the day before that was different or unusual?",

    "q_4486": "No, that's great. OK, do you plan on cutting it down further or do you wanna stay right there?",

    "q_4491": "Hmm, I see. Do you, do you have a family doctor?",
    "q_4492": "Yeah, well, you know it's, it's a good idea to see your family doctor on a regular basis, specially when you're getting older, because sometimes you might need changes in your medications, or there might be checkups or screenings that they might want to do. It's for your own benefit, you know, maybe even just seeing them once a year would be a good idea. I would definitely recommend that you book an appointment with them just for a checkup in the next couple of weeks. Is there a reason why you don't see your family doctor too often?",
    "q_4493": "OK, ok, I see, uhm, alright, and do you live alone or do you live with other people?",

Sometimes with tuberculosis you can get something called pericarditis, and some of the symptoms you are having may point to pericarditis as well, so we might have to do an EKG. We might have to further do an ultrasound, an x-ray, for example. So first we'll just get the TB test done and then if it comes back positive, you will need to isolate, be admitted to the hospital as well, and be on a course of antibiotics.

In the meantime, rhinitis is, allergic rhinitis is caused by allergies to certain things, so we can get him allergy tested um and that will give us a better understanding of like what his triggers are and the way to treat that is to avoid those triggers, those allergens. And if his symptoms are persistent, um we will prescribe him also like an intranasal corticosteroid. Um and there are like, there are like second line treatments as well, like antihistamines and leukotriene, like leukotriene receptor antagonists, but those are like second line. We'll we'll see how he does with the inhaled corticosteroids at first. How does that sound?",

Um let me go talk to my my preceptor and we'll come and do physical exams and listen to your chest and uh do a few uh lab tests to draw your blood and do a chest X Ray likely and then um uh go from there. You, it sounds like um sounds like with the with the fuzzy feeling, the fevers, the difficulties breathing, I think it would be a good idea for you to stay here for a couple of days maybe, but we'll um we'll let you know what happens and what the results show. I'm really glad that you decided to come in today. Do you have any questions for me?",
    "q_5316": "Have you checked your temperature?",

    "q_5318": "Um why is that?",
    "q_5319": "Yeah, OK, but it's not that you can't um, you can't sort of like, you don't feel like it's getting stuck?",
    "q_5320": "Um and have you noticed any changes in your voice?",

    "q_5340": "OK, well we recommend that you you get your vaccines and um also the uh HPV vaccine. Um it's it's best to get the HPV vaccine earlier on. It's a little bit less effective as you um go past a certain age, you are still obviously nowhere close to that, but it's,  I I don't believe it's covered after the age of 26 either, so it's best if you get it done earlier. And let's go back to your symptoms, then. Have you had any surgeries?",
    "q_5341": "Anything else?",
    "q_5342": "OK, are you taking any medications including over the counter?",

    "q_5358": " Um do you uh, so no travels, OK. Do you feel like you've been in contact with someone who might be sick or might have Covid?",
    "q_5359": "No, OK alright. And have you looked at your throat?",
    "q_5360": " Does it look swollen or red?",
    "q_5361": "Well, that's all the questions, oh one more question actually. Do you have um any medical conditions that run in the family?",
    "q_5362": "Uh all right, well um that's all the questions I had. We'll do a physical exam, have a look inside your throat. Um given uh the symptoms that you have, it sounds like you have um an an inflammation or swelling of your throat which could be caused by bacteria or viruses. It could be something like um mono, or it could be um strep throat. Um it could be other things as well. Um seeing that your symptoms are somewhat overlapping with the symptoms for covid, we would also like to do a Covid test. Um we'll do a rapid strep test here as well um just to rule it out and then uh we'll uh ask you to quarantine for the next 14 days um until or at least until your covid swabs are back or your symptoms improve um and we'll let you know about um the management based on the strep test result. Do you have any questions?",
    "q_5363": "So you said that all of this started about a day ago. How was he doing before that?",
    "q_5364": "Um OK, so he had these symptoms about a week ago. Did he see any, did you take him to the hospital or to a clinic?",
    "q_5365": "OK, has he been um has he been, how many diapers is he um, are you changing a day?",

    "q_5369": "That's it?",
    "q_5370": "OK, um and, OK. Do you feel like he's been drowsy uh and um lethargic?",
    "q_5371": "OK, and just a couple of questions about um his past medical history. Does he have any uh medical conditions uh that he was diagnosed with?",

    "q_5379": "OK, and and he's been OK for the past two years?",
    "q_5380": " Any concerns about his growth, his height and weight, and his head circumference?",
    "q_5381": " Has your family doctor uh said anything about that?",
    "q_5382": "Any um developmental issues?",
    "q_5383": "OK, alright, and any medical conditions that run in the family?",

    "q_5391": "Any allergies?",
    "q_5392": "OK alright um well it looks like um I, it's great that you brought him into the emergency room. Um if he hasn't been eating, drinking well, hasn't slept well, has been fussy, and and has been lethargic and tired, uh and is having difficulty swallowing food, um that's definitely very um serious. Uh we'll have a look inside his mouth and see what's going on. It could be that he has an infection or an inflammation of some sort. Um given his fever, he probably has an infection, um and uh we'll likely start him on antibiotics and put in an IV drip just to get in get some fluids inside him, just to get him hydrated, uh and monitor him very closely. We'll also check his vitals and um we'll do uh, yeah, we'll go from there. Do you have any questions?",
    "q_5393": "Yeah, yeah, that's great. So can you tell me, have you, did you measure your temperature?",
    "q_5394": "OK, but we can take your vitals here um and uh you you said that you've had a cough for the past four days, dry cough or wet cough?",

    "q_5405": "Is it both sides or on the uh left or right?",
    "q_5406": "If you had to give it a number from 1 to 10 with 10 being the most severe pain ever, what number would you give it?",
    "q_5407": "Oh wow, OK. And how's it changed over the past four days?",
    "q_5408": "Um is it uh is it, what was I gonna say, is it constant or does it come and go?",

So uh looks like you've had a fever, cough, and a um and a headache that's gotten worse in the past four days and your headache's pretty bad, a seven out of ten. Um and uh it could be that you have uh some sort of an infection, uh including um, with Covid being one of the possibilities, and so um continue to take Tylenol and and um monitor your uh fever. If it continues to get worse, or you um notice that your symptoms are just not getting better, um you should come back, you should uh, we'll also do a Covid, we'll also send in a request for a Covid swab. Um and uh we'll ask you to quarantine for the for the next 14 days and try to stay away from your husband and daughter as well, if you can at home. Um and uh I guess a couple of other questions that I wanted to ask and I should have asked earlier, do you have any um any stiffness in your neck or any difficulties moving your neck?",

    "q_5453": "White, OK. Um and is it constant throughout the day or do you find it comes and goes?",
    "q_5454": "OK. Um and if you were to describe the quality of this cough, would you say it's harsh, barky, muffled?",

    "q_5456": " Like does it sound different than it used to?",

    "q_5506": " Outside the province?",
    "q_5507": "OK, OK. Um so those were kind of all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for me?",
    "q_5508": "Yeah, so it definitely sounds like a COPD exacerbation, but because your symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will take a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and you can you can self isolate for 14 days um and if it's positive, public health will be in touch with you to um do some contact tracing, but in the meantime we'll also do a work up for the COPD exacerbation. Um it seems like you have taken the correct steps so far in like stopping like stopping your smoking and um taking your puffers as needed. Um so right now we will continue using the puffers that you have, and if you don't already have a long acting beta agonist, we'll give you that as well as, if it's like if it gets really severe, we'll also give you some inhaled corticosteroids um and we'll also check your oxygen saturation to make sure it's over uh 88% um and we'll give you oxygen if you need it. Um as well, some antibiotics to consider, you mentioned that you were allergic to amoxicillin, so we might give you like a macrolide like azithromycin for now. Um and hopefully your symptoms subside and we can get you home. How does that sound?",
    "q_5509": "OK, uhm, alright. So let's back up just a little bit. The ear pain, when did that start?",
    "q_5510": " You said a couple of days ago, so was that two, three, four days?",
    "q_5511": "Yeah, so three, four days. OK, have you taken a look into his ear?",
    "q_5512": " Like does does it seem red?",
    "q_5513": " Is there discharge?",
    "q_5514": "OK, clear to, you said white-ish?",
    "q_5515": "Yellow, OK, OK. And which ear was it, sorry, the right or left?",
    "q_5516": "Left ear, OK. And the right ear looks normal?",
    "q_5517": "OK, is he itching his ears at all?",
    "q_5518": "OK, and does it look like it's angry on the outside or on the inside of his ears?",
    "q_5519": "OK, OK, and have you noticed that his hearing has changed at all?",
    "q_5520": "OK. Has he had any past issues with his ears, like ear infections or like hearing issues in the past?",
    "q_5521": "OK, OK. Were they were they treated with antibiotics?",
    "q_5522": "OK, OK. He's never had to get like tubes inserted or anything like that?",
    "q_5523": "No, OK. Um, alright. Um has he had a stuffy nose or runny nose?",
    "q_5524": "OK, he was a bit stuffy, you said?",
    "q_5525": "OK. And that stopped. Did he have anything else along with his stuffy nose at that point?",
    "q_5526": "Um right now, have you noticed any changes in his vision, in his smell or taste?",
    "q_5527": "OK, how about weight loss?",
    "q_5528": "OK, and you said um you had taken his temperature. When did you take his temperature?",
    "q_5529": "OK, OK sweet. Um so 39 degrees, so he does have a fever uh for sure. We'll take his temperature again today just to make sure. Have you been giving him anything for his high temperature, like Tylenol?",
    "q_5530": "OK. Have you noticed any rashes on him?",
    "q_5531": "No, um how about coughing?",
    "q_5532": "No coughing, how about wheezing or shortness of breath?",
    "q_5533": "Like anything that would indicate he has chest pain or palpitations of his heart?",
    "q_5534": "No, OK. Any dizziness or fainting spells?",
    "q_5535": "Confusion?",
    "q_5536": "Headaches?",
    "q_5537": "OK, and how how have his bowel movements been?",
    "q_5538": "No, OK. Um alright, and how about uh nausea or vomiting?",
    "q_5539": "Any appetite change?",

    "q_5547": "OK, OK, good. And is he on any medications?",
    "q_5548": "No medications, up to date with his immunizations?",
    "q_5549": "OK, any allergies?",

    "q_5861": "Yeah, well I would, I would recommend that you try to eat when people are not in the room if possible because you are putting yourself at risk.  Like if it's a small room, I think you should also talk to management or try to limit the number of people who can be in the room at a time. Um, for your own safety, you know, and for the safety of others uh, working with you. Um okay, and um, have you traveled anywhere recently?",
    "q_5862": "Okay, good, um, and who do you live with?",

And then you've also developed a fever, but you haven't, or I guess you've been feeling, you've been having chills uh, and we can measure temperature here, and you also had a cough that started yesterday. What about um, sense of taste?",
    "q_5879": " Have you noticed any changes there?",
    "q_5880": "What about your sense of smell?",
    "q_5881": "We will also get a COVID swab done, simply because your symptoms sound very similar to um, or I guess a lot of these symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID, so we'll do that. And um, I would require, would request that you continue to uh, stay at home if you haven't been doing so so far. Um, take a leave from work, try to do work from home, and quarantine at home as much as possible and stay away from your wife and your daughter as well, at least until the swab is back and you get some more guidance from uh, public health. If it is positive, they will give you a call. Um, there are lots of guidelines on how to self isolate and I, I can share that with you. Um, it's best that you do that for now. Um, we will run a couple of tests, do labs, and based on those results, uh, we'll decide if you need to stay in the ER or if we can um, if you can be discharged later today. Do you have any questions for me?",
    "q_5882": "So you've had this, when did this start?",
    "q_5883": "Um, okay. Okay, what did you, is there anything, so it's basically worse when you're um, doing some sort of an exercise such as walking um, or being in the gym class, and it's also worse in the cold?",
    "q_5884": "Okay um, alright. Uh um okay, sorry, one moment. Okay um, so is there anything that makes your cough better?",
    "q_5885": " What do you do to make it go away?",
    "q_5886": "And you said that sometimes you also have difficulties breathing with it?",
    "q_5887": "I see. So this started a couple of months ago, has this ever happened to you before that?",

    "q_5899": "Any acid reflux?",
    "q_5900": "Okay, um, and any certain muscle aches or joint pains?",
    "q_5901": "Any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs?",
    "q_5902": "Okay, let's get back. Okay, great, it sounds like that the, the cough is sort of the main symptom here that you have. Um, is the cough dry or wet?",
    "q_5903": "Uh sorry, can you say that again?",
    "q_5904": "Okay um, have you ever brought up any sputum or any blood?",
    "q_5905": "Okay, alright. Um okay, and, uh, have you been vaccinated?",
    "q_5906": "Okay, good good good. Um, does the cough sound like a barky cough or a muffled cough, or um, does it have a specific characteristic?",
    "q_5907": " Does it sound different than when you're sort of coughing to clear your throat, for instance?",
    "q_5908": "Okay, okay. Okay, so you're wheezing. Okay, so you ever um, cough so much that you end up vomiting?",
    "q_5909": "Um, and do you, so you mentioned that it's worse when you're in the cold or exercising, and smoking makes it worse?",
    "q_5910": " What about things like dust or pollen?",
    "q_5911": " Um, say when you're cleaning the house and there's also dust, does that make things worse, or is it worse in a specific time of the year when you're outdoors?",
    "q_5912": "Alright. Uh, can you tell me, okay so, can you tell me if you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?",
    "q_5913": "Okay. Had, did, when you were a child, did you have any sort of rash?",
    "q_5914": " Did you have eczema?",
    "q_5915": "Okay. And um, have you ever had allergic rhinitis, which is basically sort of having um, red or teary eyes, itchiness on the face, a runny nose at certain times of the year, or in um, areas with mold or dust, or termites and things like that?",
    "q_5916": " Have you had anything like that as a child or right now?",
    "q_5917": "Okay. Alright, uh do you have any, um, I guess going back, were you a healthy child, growing up?",
    "q_5918": "Okay, that's great. Do you uh, did you ever have any hospitalizations?",
    "q_5919": "Any surgeries?",
    "q_5920": "Are you taking any medications?",
    "q_5921": "Are you still using the eczema cream?",
    "q_5922": "Okay, good. Are you allergic to anything?",
    "q_5923": "What happens then?",
    "q_5924": "Um, have you ever seen an allergist?",
    "q_5925": "No. Uh, who prescribed the cream for the eczema?",
    "q_5926": "Okay, okay. Um alright, and do you have any family history of any um, lung-related problems?",
    "q_5927": " Or any other problems?",
    "q_5928": "Alright, and you mentioned that things are going well at school. Um, who do you live with at home?",
    "q_5929": "Okay, okay. And things are good at home?",

    "q_5932": "Okay are you uh, are you taking any marijuana or any street drugs?",
    "q_5933": "What about alcohol?",
    "q_5934": "Okay, okay. Just wanted to mention that the conversation that we're having right now is confidential between you and me. Um, unless you mentioned anything that harms you or harms anyone else so, so feel free to discuss whatever or talk openly about um, any issues that you have. Um, okay, and um, are you sexually active?",
    "q_5935": "Alright, okay. So um, that's all the information I needed. Uh given that you've had these coughing fits for the past couple of months that are, that have certain triggers, uh, and also given that you've had a history of eczema, and your sister has asthma, so kind of, sort of runs in your family in a way. You might also have a diagnosis of asthma potentially. Um, and so, what I would recommend is that you get um, testing done and um, uh I guess before I sort of talk a little more about this, I just want to get a sense of how severe your asthma, if it's asthma at all, um if, does it, does it affect your ability to, you said school was going okay, does it affect your ability to do well at school at all?",
    "q_5936": "Does it wake you up at night?",
    "q_5937": "Okay, okay. Um, and how often, I guess is, do these episodes occur?",
    "q_5938": " How many times a week, or how many times a month?",
    "q_5939": "Um, so we can talk about that. Um, given that your symptoms are, yes, they've been occurring for the past couple of months, but because you have had a cough, it might be a good idea just to have a COVID test done once. Um, I don't think that's what you have, seeing that this, these symptoms have been lasting for, have been occurring for the past two months, so we'll just kind of do that test to rule it out. Um, in the meantime, I would recommend that you um, try this inhaled corticosteroid puffer that you can use, that you should use on a daily basis, and try to avoid uh, the triggers. So the things that you, that cause these symptoms. Um, we can go over how to use uh, a puffer properly and I will also give you a spacer, which will help deliver most of that medication in the, uh, to your lungs. Do you have any questions?",
    "q_5940": "Okay, yeah, so it's been going on for like more than a week. Um, can you describe to me what kind of cough you're having?",
    "q_5941": " Is it like a wet cough or a dry cough?",
    "q_5942": "Okay, and has it been getting worse over the, over the time period you described?",
    "q_5943": "It's the same. Um, have you noticed, although it's like dry, have you brought up any kind of sputum or phlegm at all?",
    "q_5944": "Okay, um and have you noticed any kind of yellowish to greenish tinge to it?",
    "q_5945": "Watery, okay. Have you noticed at all, any blood, have you been coughing up any blood at all?",
    "q_5946": "Okay, and is your cough like constant or does it come and go?",
    "q_5947": "Okay, and is there a pattern to it?",
    "q_5948": " Like, uh, do you cough more when you're exerting yourself or any time, a certain time of the day?",
    "q_5949": "When you're smoking, okay. And uh, how long do those episodes last?",
    "q_5950": "Okay, and has this happened to you before at all?",
    "q_5951": "Okay, and is there any anything that makes it better or worse?",
    "q_5952": "Okay. And um, have you found that it's been helping over, like, to help improve your cough over the last few days?",
    "q_5953": "I see. Does it keep keep you up at night at all?",
    "q_5954": "No, okay. Are you having any other symptoms like shortness of breath, um sore throat, runny nose, anything like that?",
    "q_5955": "Okay, okay. And have you been in contact with anyone that's been sick around you at all?",
    "q_5956": "When was that?",
    "q_5957": "Two weeks ago?",
    "q_5958": " Okay. And uh, how is she now like, did it just go away on its own, or did she have to go to the doctor?",
    "q_5959": "Okay. Have you traveled at all recently outside of the province or the country?",
    "q_5960": "No, okay. And besides the cough, are you having any headaches at all?",
    "q_5961": "Any nausea or vomiting?",
    "q_5962": "Any fevers or chills?",

    "q_5997": "Okay, and that's really good.

    "q_6177": "Yeah, so we're gonna since he's never been diagnosed before, we're gonna do some investigations for him just to start so we can do, we can start by doing a pulmonary function test for him to see what his lung activity is like uhm so we'll start there and then we'll also, because you're saying he's short of breath, we'll take his oxygen saturation as well, and maybe even do some like some basic blood work for him, and if it turns out he has asthma, which in this case I do strongly suspect, we'll prescribe him some bronchodilators like a short acting beta agonist as well as an inhaled corticosteroid because his symptoms do seem somewhat severe this time around. And then I should also mention because some of his symptoms overlap with that of COVID, he will also get a covid swab and you should hear back about that in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?",
    "q_6178": "OK, so you said the runny nose started two days ago?",

    "q_6205": "No, OK, how about uhm after birth?",
    "q_6206": " Was he hospitalized for any reason?",
    "q_6207": "OK, that's good. Uhm and has he been developing normally in terms of his motor movements, like behavior wise, social wise, like is he on par with his peers in terms of milestones?",
    "q_6208": "OK, good. growing while gaining weight well, OK, is he on any medications?",

    "q_6212": "No OK. Does anyone at home smoke?",
    "q_6213": "OK OK, any old carpet, dust, mold, asbestos, anything like that in your home?",
    "q_6214": "No. OK. Who does he live with?",
    "q_6215": "OK. Any pets at home?",
    "q_6216": "OK. Has he been in contact with anyone sick recently?",
    "q_6217": "OK is he in like daycare?",
    "q_6218": "OK, any trouble recently?",
    "q_6219": "No, OK. Well, those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?",
    "q_6220": "Yeah, for sure, so right now it sounds like a viral picture. It sounds like he has a cold and possibly an ear infection. I'd have to take a look into his ear to be able to tell more uhm because some of his symptoms overlap with those of covid we'll probably do a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm and so after I take a look into his ears, we can do one of a couple of things, so if his tympanic membrane looks like it's been perforated, or if there's pus in there, then we'll prescribe him a 10 day course of antibiotics, and if I see like middle ear effusion or his tympanic membranes bulging, and he seems really sick like he has a high fever, what she does, I will again prescribe him 10 days of antibiotics. And if he has a middle ear effusion or a bulging tympanic membrane, just one of those two, and he doesn't seem to be too sick, we can reassess him in 24 to 48 hours. Uhm An antibiotic that we usually prescribe is amoxicillin. Uhh how does that sound?",
    "q_6221": "Okay, well that's not good. So you said the cough started several months ago, how many months ago do you think, like three, four, five?",
    "q_6222": "Okay and um, the blood in the cough, when did that start?",
    "q_6223": "Two weeks ago, okay. Um, how much blood are you coughing up like, if uh, like is it the size of your palm, is it more than that, less than that?",
    "q_6224": "Okay, sure. Um, and are you experiencing any shortness of breath along with your cough?",
    "q_6225": "Yeah, for sure. Um, and sorry you said, you mentioned, you mentioned you had some wheezing as well, right?",
    "q_6226": "No, okay. Um, and have you had a fever recently?",
    "q_6227": "Weight loss?",
    "q_6228": "Last month, okay. Um, any chills, fever, sorry, chills, or night sweats?",
    "q_6229": "Okay, any rashes?",
    "q_6230": "Changes in your vision or hearing?",
    "q_6231": "Um, how about a stuffy or runny nose?",
    "q_6232": "Okay um, and then change in your smell or taste?",
    "q_6233": "Okay, and how about chest pain?",
    "q_6234": "Okay. Um, and do you ever feel like your heart's racing?",
    "q_6235": "Okay, how about calf pain when you walk, like more than a block or two?",
    "q_6236": "Okay, any changes to your bowel movements?",
    "q_6237": "Okay, any nausea or vomiting?",
    "q_6238": "Uh, changes to your urine?",
    "q_6239": "No. Uh, headaches?",
    "q_6240": "Sure, um, how about dizziness or fainting spells?",
    "q_6241": "Okay, um, any confusion or memory loss?",
    "q_6242": "Okay, sure. Um, and then other questions I have for you, are um, are you otherwise healthy?",
    "q_6243": " Do you have any major medical, medical conditions?",
    "q_6244": "Sure. Do you take any medications for these things?",
    "q_6245": "Okay. Okay, and um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?",
    "q_6246": "Um, so yeah, after you turn 65, they should've given you the Shingrix for shingles and pneumococcal vaccine, does that sound familiar?",
    "q_6247": "Okay yeah, sure. Any allergies that you have?",
    "q_6248": "No. How about family history of lung or heart conditions?",
    "q_6249": "Okay, okay. And do you currently smoke?",
    "q_6250": "Yeah, no problem. Do you do any other recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, anything like that?",
    "q_6251": "Oh okay, are those prescribed drops?",
    "q_6252": "Okay, good. Um, and where do you live right now?",
    "q_6253": " And who do you live with?",
    "q_6254": "Okay, And any like, old carpets, dust, mold, or asbestos in this apartment?",
    "q_6255": "Okay yeah, for sure. Um, have you been in contact with anyone sick recently?",
    "q_6256": "Okay, good. How about travel?",
    "q_6257": "Okay, okay, good. Um, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?",
    "q_6258": "Yeah, for sure. Um, so they're a couple of things we're gonna work you up for. Um, because some of your symptoms overlap with COVID, we'll start by getting a COVID swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um, we will also do a chest x-ray um, to look for any signs of lung cancer. Um, and then if we see consolidation or anything that would indicate um, like a mass in your lungs, we will discuss options for like biopsies which is the gold standard for diagnosing lung cancers. Also, I know you haven't had any recent travel or anything like that and your symptoms have been going on for a long time, but uh, it may also be worthwhile to uh, also check for things like TB, which could also cause you to cough up blood. Um, so we'll start, we'll start from there, and then if those come back negative, then we'll work you up further for other things that you may have, but are like more rare. How does that sound?",
    "q_6259": "Okay, well I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. Um, the cough, when did that start?",
    "q_6260": "Okay, and then how about the headache?",
    "q_6261": "Two days, okay, and then the uh, muscle ache?",
    "q_6262": "Um, the cough, is it dry or you're bringing up phlegm?",
    "q_6263": "Okay, and does it sound harsh?",
    "q_6264": "Okay. Is it getting worse do you think?",
    "q_6265": "Okay, are you experiencing any shortness of breath along with the cough?",
    "q_6266": "Okay, any wheeziness?",
    "q_6267": "No. Chest pain?",
    "q_6268": "Okay. Do you ever feel like your heart's racing?",
    "q_6269": "Okay. Um, any dizziness or fainting spells?",
    "q_6270": "Uh, numbness or tingling?",
    "q_6271": "Uh confusion or memory loss?",
    "q_6272": "This headache, is it always there?",
    "q_6273": "Yeah um, sides of your head, okay. And 1 to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt, how, how would you rate it?",
    "q_6274": "A 4 okay, so it's not the worst headache you've ever had in your life?",
    "q_6275": "Yeah um, okay. And have you like, do you usually get headaches?",
    "q_6276": "Okay yeah, that makes sense. Um, have you had any fevers recently?",
    "q_6277": "Okay. How about weight loss, have you experienced any weight loss recently?",

    "q_6284": "Okay um, and then nausea or vomiting?",
    "q_6285": "Okay um, changes in your urine?",
    "q_6286": "Okay, good. And are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions?",
    "q_6287": "Okay. Um, do you also take anything else for that asthma or is it just the Ventolin that use?",
    "q_6288": "Okay. Have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?",
    "q_6289": "Okay. Um, are you on any medications besides Ventolin?",
    "q_6290": "Okay, how long have you been on that for?",
    "q_6291": "Okay, and um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?",
    "q_6292": "Okay, okay, good. Any allergies?",

    "q_6302": "Okay, and is everyone at home healthy?",
    "q_6303": "Okay. Okay, well those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions um, or anything that you wanted to bring up that I haven't covered?",
    "q_6304": "Yeah for sure. We will definitely um, take a swab from you today and we'll see um, what the results are. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but in the meantime you should self isolate for 14 days um, and if it's not COVID, if that comes back negative, and um yeah, some of your symptoms also sound like other typical viral symptoms, so you could have one of the common strains that's going around this time of year. So for that just, it's um, you should just um, do some supportive care, you know, staying hydrated, eating well. And if your symptoms become worse, uh, you're running a really high fever, you have any neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures, then you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?",
    "q_6305": "Yeah, for sure. And, so you said the cough started uh, three days ago. Were there any triggers to the cough or anything that, uh that changed three days ago?",
    "q_6306": "Okay, uh, has the cough gotten any better, or stayed the same, or gotten worse these past three days?",

Um, and that's, that can also be a possibility and what we will do is get a chest x-ray, get some blood work done as well today.

    "q_6668": "Okay, so yeah, there's definitely like the coughing and shortness of breath are definitely concerning, and they've been going on for a pretty long time. Do you ever have any night sweats or anything like that?",
    "q_6669": "Okay. So there's a few things that we think about with the chronic shortness of breath and a cough. One could be just a COPD diagnosis with your long history of smoking. And this pulmonary function test, get an x-ray, chest x-ray as well. Um another thing that we need to look out for is uh, lung cancer. And since you have been smoking for a pretty long time, even though you may have quit, which is really great, but that long history of smoking, especially also with um, you working in a mine, those are some things that means we can test as well, and so we may require like a chest x-ray, and even um, a CT scan of your lungs as well. Um, so yeah, first we'll just do a couple tests, do a physical examination, get your vitals, do some blood work and do some of those tests and then we'll also get a COVID swab test done for you as well, just in case. Does that sound good?",
    "q_6670": "Okay, and um, is it getting worse at all really?",

    "q_6674": "Um, would you describe it as like a, a barking cough, a harsh cough, or a muffled cough?",
    "q_6675": "No, okay. Um, before you started uh, coughing, did you have any other symptoms, like runny nose, congestion, sore throat, anything like that?",
    "q_6676": "Okay, so it's just the cough?",
    "q_6677": "Okay. Any fevers or chills?",
    "q_6678": "Okay, and is the cough constant, or does it come and go?",
    "q_6679": "It's there throughout the day, okay. And is it brought on by any activities or, or does it just come on by itself?",

Um, so I guess I, at this point I would like to maybe have it, examine you, just have a look inside your throat, maybe feel your neck for those lumps, and uh, then decide what to do from there. Um, given your symptoms, um, this could be a viral infection, or um, it could be a bacterial infection caused by um, bacteria called, or I guess, strep, strep throat. It could also be uh, mono. Um, but I'll uh, I'll have a look, we'll do the rapid strep test and uh, based on those results, we'll decide what to do. If it is strep, you might require antibiotics. If not, if it's mono and if we can do maybe a blood test for that, you might have to um, not engage in, in physical activity um, or exercise, vigorous activity, or like sports for the next couple of weeks or months as, as that can be, uh, as that can cause problems if you get hit in the, in your belly. It could cause your spleen to rupture and sometimes your spleen become very big if you do have mono, but we'll discuss all of that a little bit more after we do uh, the strep test. We'll also check your temperature, um, and see um, how you're doing. Have you been taking anything to help yourself, to help soothe your sore throat?",
    "q_6815": "Okay, um, so can you tell me about your cough?",
    "q_6816": "No blood?",
    "q_6817": "Okay, and the runny nose, what, what's the discharge like?",

It's possible that you just have a common cold uh, and that symptoms will get better over time. But just in case, we would also like to do a COVID swab, um, to make sure that you, just to rule out COVID. In the meantime, I would request that you isolate, self isolate at home. Stay away from your parents as well. Um, the test results should come back in 24 to 48 hours and public health will give you a call if your results are positive and we'll let you know what to do. Um, we will also do a physical exam here and check your temperature to see if you have a fever at all and um, yeah, does that sound good to you?",

But it does sound like what you're telling me with the wet cough and you know a little bit of shortness of breath, I think it's worthwhile to get a chest x-ray to see if you might possibly have a pneumonia, and if you do, if there is some consolidation we'll probably prescribe some antibiotics for that. Umm, how does that sound to you?",

    "q_7837": "OK, alright. Those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?",
    "q_7838": "Yeah, sorry. What have you tried at home again?",
    "q_7839": "OK, yeah. So your symptoms, OK because some some of these things overlap with Covid, we're going to have to swab you and they'll notify you of your results in like 24 to 48 hours. But what it sounds like is something called Sinu, Sinusitis and it sounds like acute bacterial rhinosinusitis because of some f the symptoms that you have, and it's been going on for more than a week and it's, it's not going away with the rinse, saline rinses and these decongestants. So we will prescribe some antibiotics for you. Probably amoxicillin. Take those for five to seven days and see if some of your symptoms clear up. If they continue to be severe, umm, actually, at this will also prescribe you some inhaled corticosteroids because I think those can help as well, so will give you both of those for now and then just follow up with us in a week after you've tried both things and we'll see how your symptoms are holding up at that point.

    "q_7846": "OK, and the runny nose, what kind of discharge, or what like what's coming out of your nose?",
    "q_7847": "OK, alright, and when did that start?",

    "q_8233": "OK. Any old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, anything that could exacerbate his condition?",
    "q_8234": "OK, good. Umm, so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?",
    "q_8235": "OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?",
    "q_8236": "Last two days. OK. Uhm, all of these symptoms have been going on for the last two days or just like one or two?",
    "q_8237": "OK. OK. Alright, so the cough is it a productive cough or is it a dry cough?",
    "q_8238": "Dry, OK. So no sputum, no blood?",
    "q_8239": "Any shortness of breath with that?",
    "q_8240": "OK, wheeziness?",
    "q_8241": "Chest pain?",
    "q_8242": "OK. The fever, did you measure it yourself?",
    "q_8243": "OK, and the runny nose is it clear?",
    "q_8244": " Or does it have like a colour to it like yellow or green?",
    "q_8245": "Clear, OK. Alright and does he feel like he also has a stuffy nose or is it just a runny nose?",
    "q_8246": "OK. Any symptoms like redness, any discharge?",
    "q_8247": "OK, how about hearing wise?",
    "q_8248": "And visions been normal?",
    "q_8249": "OK. Any ear pain or discharge?",
    "q_8250": "OK, how about a change in smell or taste?",

    "q_8257": "OK, any changes in his bowel movements?",
    "q_8258": "No, OK. Natural vomiting?",
    "q_8259": "OK, uhm how about changes to his appetite?",
    "q_8260": "Is he still eating solids?",
    "q_8261": "OK, yeah. And ah, are there any changes to his urine?",
    "q_8262": "OK. Uhm, any past medical illnesses or any longstanding medical conditions that he has?",
    "q_8263": "OK, any hospitalizations or surgeries?",
    "q_8264": "OK. Any complications with his mother's pregnancy with him?",
    "q_8265": "OK. And was it an emergency C-section?",
    "q_8266": "OK, OK. And is he on any medications?",
    "q_8267": "No, OK. And developmental wise has he been hitting all his milestones for like motor movements, speech, behaviour, social, socialization wise?",

    "q_8272": "OK. Uhm, alright and does anyone at home smoke?",
    "q_8273": "No, OK. And who does he live with?",
    "q_8274": "OK. And at home. any reason to think that old carpet, dust, mold, asbestos, anything like that could be making his symptoms worse?",
    "q_8275": "OK, and and those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?",
    "q_8276": "OK, yeah, so it sounds or actually I should start by saying we should get a Covid swab on him just in case it is Covid because some of his symptoms overlap with those symptoms of Covid. Umm, you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with the results of those swabs. And in the meantime, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year. And from the sounds of it, you said he has a fever. He's coughing and he has a runny nose and has muscle aches. It could also be the flu. Regardless of what kind of viral and viral infection he has, the best way to manage it right now is just supportive care, so making sure he's hydrated, eating foods with a lot of nutrition and just keep an eye on his symptoms. If it gets worse or if it's very severe and he has focal neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, take him to the ER right away. How does that sound?",
    "q_8277": "OK, yeah, that's a lot of weight. So the weight loss, you said 20 to 30 pounds?",
    "q_8278": "OK, so that was in the past six months. When do the cough start?",
    "q_8279": "Hm, OK. And is it a dry cough or is it a productive cough?",
    "q_8280": "It's been dry?",
    "q_8281": "So no blood or sputum?",
    "q_8282": "OK. And have you been feeling short of breath at all?",
    "q_8283": "OK. Alright, and is there wheeziness as well?",

    "q_8328": "At home, OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?",
    "q_8329": "Yeah, for sure. So that is quite high on my differential right now just because of your age, your smoking history and just the way you're presenting. So we're gonna do a couple of things. We're going to do a Covid swab just to rule that out. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but we will do investigations for lung cancer, so we'll start by doing a chest x-ray just to look for a mass or effusions and then from there if we think there are signs of cancer, we can do a CT. Umm, as well we can like stage with the Pet CT after we take a biopsy and send it off for pathology and that should give us more answers as to if you have cancer and if you do have cancer, what type of cancer so that we can talk about treatment plans and kind of what the prognosis is with those particular types of cancers?",

Uhm, we can get his temperature, get his oxygen oxygen saturation right away we'll get a chest x-ray. We'll do some blood work as well and uhm, he might need to be admitted depending on uhm, the oxygen, oxygen saturation and the fact that he's grunting. So if he's admitted will give him some extra oxygen and keep monitoring him and keep him hydrated. Uhm we'll also give him some antibiotics if, if it turns out he has pneumonia.

    "q_9296": "Um yeah, so the first thing we want to rule out as covid because a lot of your symptoms overlap with those of covid, so we'll take a swab and you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days. And if your results are positive, public health will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing. But if it's not covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around this time of year that could be causing similar symptoms as well, but either way the management kind of is supportive, so making sure you're well hydrated, eating nutritious food, sleeping well, taking antipyretics like Tylenol for fever's if you get any. And you can also take Tylenol or anseads for muscle ache, joint pains, anything like that. Does that sound OK?",
    "q_9297": "OK, you said you were diagnosed with COPD couple years ago. Was that two years ago?",
    "q_9298": " Three years ago?",
    "q_9299": "Five years ago, OK, and have you always had this cough since then?",
    "q_9300": "And you you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned that this cough has gotten worse over the last week?",
    "q_9301": "OK. And is it a dry cough or are you bringing up any phlem?",
    "q_9302": "OK, any blood in there?",
    "q_9303": "OK and you said you were also short of breath, uhm when did that start?",
    "q_9304": "OK. Alright, and do you get short of breath when you're laying down?",
    "q_9305": "OK, how about when you're asleep?",
    "q_9306": " Does it wake you up and kind of make you gasp for air?",
    "q_9307": "No OK. So no orthopnea or PND. Alright, and the puffers that you're on, can you remind me which ones you're on again?",
    "q_9308": "OK, how often?",
    "q_9309": " How?",
    "q_9310": " How many times this week have you had to use your ventilin?",
    "q_9311": "OK. Alright, any chest pain?",
    "q_9312": "OK, OK. Alright and then any palpitations or feeling like your heart's racing?",
    "q_9313": "OK. Alright, and do you ever feel like your calves hurt after you walk awhile?",
    "q_9314": "No OK, any dizziness or fainting spells?",
    "q_9315": "OK. Numbness or tingling?",
    "q_9316": "Confusion or memory loss?",
    "q_9317": "Headaches?",

    "q_9323": "OK, sore throat?",
    "q_9324": "Any changes in your vision or hearing?",
    "q_9325": "Changes in your smell or taste?",
    "q_9326": "OK, how about weight loss?",
    "q_9327": "OK, chills?",
    "q_9328": "OK, so you haven't actually measured your temperature right?",
    "q_9329": "OK, we can do that today. Any rashes?",
    "q_9330": "Fatigue?",
    "q_9331": "OK, um and besides the COPD do you have any other longstanding medical conditions?",
    "q_9332": "OK. And what kind of blood pressure medications did you use to take, and how come you stopped?",
    "q_9333": "OK, well, we'll keep checking your blood pressure and that's something you should keep an eye on as well, just in case ou have complications with your kidneys. Does that sound OK?",
    "q_9334": "OK uhm?",
    "q_9335": " And are you on any medications other than the puffers?",
    "q_9336": "For your cholesterol OK, and are you up to date with your immunizations?",

    "q_9341": "Just your father OK. How much do you smoke?",
    "q_9342": "OK, alright, well, it's good that you're cutting down. And if you need more resources to help you do that, we have some available that we can refer you to. Do you take any other recreational drugs like cannabis, heroin, cocaine?",
    "q_9343": "OK. And do you drink alcohol?",
    "q_9344": "Couple times a month OK. And are you currently married?",
    "q_9345": "OK, and any reason for you to believe you have old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, pets, anything that could be triggering your symptoms?",
    "q_9346": "OK, OK, good, and have you been in contact with any sick people recently?",
    "q_9347": "OK, and have you traveled anywhere recently?",
    "q_9348": "OK. Alright, well those were all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions of your own?",
    "q_9349": "Yeah, you know it sounds like you have a cough and shortness of breath, and both of these things you've had for a while, but now they're getting worse and based on your past history of COPD I would say this sounds like a COPD exacerbation. So for that we will start off with some basic blood work like CBC, electrolytes, your kidney function, ABG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, as well as like a chest X Ray. And basically we should treat it we're going to take your oxygen saturation an give you some extra oxygen if you need. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to use your bronchodilators an and in addition to both of that will also give you some steroids as well as antibiotics. And just to prevent any infections or if you already have it then it can help with that as well. And because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid will also do a covid swab just to make sure it's not that. And you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?",

    "q_9392": "OK. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to go over this with the document I'm working with today, I'm guessing just because some of your symptoms are in line with common symptoms of covid 19, that will probably do a covid swab, and what happens with that is since we do have some syptoms, will have to isolate until the result come back and potentially after that if you still have symptoms, even if it is negative. So that's just kind of a heads up on that. Maybe one of the next things that happens. We will probably get you a chest xray 'cause we want to get an idea of what's going on in there. Did you have any other questions?",
    "q_9393": "Today is Friday OK. And um. OK, yeah sure uh so. Is this cough a productive cough, or is it kind of a dry cough?",

    "q_9420": "OK, any confusion or memory loss?",
    "q_9421": "And is he and is he an otherwise healthy child?",
    "q_9422": "OK, and were things normal with your pregnancy with him?",
    "q_9423": "OK um. And then how about as a newborn, any complications after birth?",
    "q_9424": "OK, and then did he hit all his milestones up till now?",
    "q_9425": "OK. Any, does he have any allergies?",
    "q_9426": "Is he up to date with all his immunizations?",
    "q_9427": "Yeah OK. And. In terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?",

    "q_9434": "No OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?",
    "q_9435": "Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a covid swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Um we do suggest because his symptoms are allowed with symptoms of covid that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister possible. And then if the swab comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays, and if his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms, like seizures or. If he's feeling weak, dizzy if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and. And so for now I'll just wait for those covid swaps to come back. How does that sound?",
    "q_9436": "OK. You said for a couple days?",
    "q_9437": "OK, have you ever had anything like this before?",
    "q_9438": "OK, when you say you feel like you've lost sense of taste and smell, is it totally gone or do you taste a little bit?",
    "q_9439": " Or how?",
    "q_9440": " How is that working for you?",
    "q_9441": "OK, is that been pretty consistent throughout the last couple of days or is it on and off?",
    "q_9442": "OK. And did this dry cough that start at the same time?",
    "q_9443": "And when you say sorry, you said mild cough, and I my next question was do you feel like it's a dry cough or you producing any sputum?",
    "q_9444": " Any blood?",
    "q_9445": " Or is it to not, not bringing up anything?",
    "q_9446": "OK, has that gotten worse over the last couple of days?",
    "q_9447": "OK is there, have you done anything to try to make it better?",
    "q_9448": " Have you taken any over the counter medications or?",
    "q_9449": "OK, OK. Have you had, in addition to these symptoms, have you had any fevers?",

    "q_9459": "OK, and can you think of any for this dry cough, just a circle back to that. Can you think of anything that triggers it?",
    "q_9460": " It's called the cold or being around certain things like cats or dogs or any other environmental things?",
    "q_9461": "OK. Have you had any chest pain?",
    "q_9462": "OK. And in terms of your general health, do you?",

We might have more questions when we come back, we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today, but just wanted to give you a heads up of what to expect next. Did you have anything else you wanted to tell me that I didn't ask you about or any questions?",
    "q_9481": "Can you tell me about what brought you in today?",
    "q_9482": "OK, are you here with your mom today?",
    "q_9483": "Hi mum. Um OK. You got a cough you said I'm sorry, you said for five days?",
    "q_9484": "OK. And, uh, has it you said it was a dry cough?",

So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to go get the doctor that I'm working with. I'm, uh, I'm wondering, you know, he might want to do a chest X Ray and get a better look at what's going on there. Have you ever had an X Ray before?",
    "q_9520": "Do you know what an X Ray is?",
    "q_9521": "Yeah it's like taking picture of your body on the inside. It's pretty cool so it gives us an idea of what's going on in the inside. Also, this really this part is kind of not so much fun, but I think we should probably do a covid swab because we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately and that's not a lot of fun. We gotta stick something up your nose, but I think that you're really brave and I think that you'll be just fine with it, OK?",
    "q_9522": "I know that you've been having experiencing a cough. Can you tell me a little bit about that?",
    "q_9523": "OK. have never had anything like this before?",
    "q_9524": "OK um. I'm gonna ask you a few questions about the cough itself. Is this a dry cough that you're experiencing?",
    "q_9525": " Or are you producing like any any mucus or coughing up anything?",
    "q_9526": "Now, it's dry OK how long, what was the timeline for that?",
    "q_9527": " I guess how long?",
    "q_9528": "OK, OK. And do you feel like the intensity of the cough got worse over the last two weeks, or has it gotten any better?",
    "q_9529": "And has the cough gotten more frequent over this time as well?",
    "q_9530": "How often would you say that you're coughing?",
    "q_9531": "Is there anything you can think of that triggers the cough, or is it spontaneous?",
    "q_9532": "OK. And along with the cough, are you experiencing any difficulty breathing?",

    "q_9597": "Alright, well that's those are all the questions I had for you. I will now do it physical exam and look at your vitals and listen to your chest. It's likely that what you have right now is COPD exacerbation, maybe just a like an infection that you got, which worsened some of your COPD symptoms. We would also have to rule out covid, so we'll be doing a covid swab and will decide based on the on your labs in your vital signs. It's instead of other things whether you need to stay in the ER and be admitted, or if you are good to go home, I will also talk to my attending and will make those decisions together and come back and talk to you. Does that sound good to you?",

    "q_9897": "OK, and aside from the weekend hike, have you been mainly self isolating or?",
    "q_9898": "OK, and do you leave the house for work at all?",
    "q_9899": "OK, sounds good. So you have some muscle aches, little bit of fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, do you have any difficulty swallowing?",
    "q_9900": "OK, so you're still able to swallow food, swallow liquids?",
    "q_9901": "It doesn't feel like anything is going down the wrong way or have any coughing after you swallow?",
    "q_9902": "OK. And just in terms of coming back to this sore throat, do you feel like you have any swelling around your neck?",
    "q_9903": " Does it feel inflamed or swollen?",
    "q_9904": "Nothing like that?",
    "q_9905": "OK, alright, excellent. So you're eating well, doing well, any changes to your bowel movements recently?",
    "q_9906": "OK, alright, I'll just kind of go into other things, just in terms of anything else that you might have had in the past, uh have you ever been hospitalized for any reason in your life?",
    "q_9907": "OK, so that was around when you were 50 years old?",
    "q_9908": "OK. And any other surgeries you've had in your life?",
    "q_9909": "No, anything you've had to see a doctor for?",
    "q_9910": "So no high blood pressure?",
    "q_9911": "No cholesterol issues?",
    "q_9912": "Excellent, OK. Do you have any allergies?",
    "q_9913": "Penicillin, what happens when you take penicillin?",
    "q_9914": "OK. Any trouble breathing?",
    "q_9915": "And what medications, if any, are you on?",
    "q_9916": "And you said you lived with your husband in a house, um in London?",
    "q_9917": "What do you two do for work?",
    "q_9918": "OK. And do you smoke?",
    "q_9919": "Do you drink alcohol?",
    "q_9920": "OK. And when you drink, how many drinks do you have?",
    "q_9921": "Got it. Any other recreational drugs, substances?",
    "q_9922": "So no marijuana, heroin, cocaine?",
    "q_9923": "Understood. And have you ever used IV drugs?",
    "q_9924": "OK, and when was your last menstrual period?",
    "q_9925": "A year ago?",
    "q_9926": "Sounds good, now we've already talked about kind of past medical issues. Moving on, I think what we'll do next is move on to a physical exam. But before I do that, do you have any questions for me?",
    "q_9927": " Anything else you feel I should know?",
    "q_9928": "It's a possibility. It's always good to rule these things out, so we'll be ordering a covid swab no matter what. Obviously with any presentation where we have someone come in with a fever and sore throat, we want to rule out anything infectious. So it sounds like if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out. So just while we're trying to investigate, work this up further, I want to have you and your husband self isolate. The other question I suppose I should ask is, have you gotten your flu shot this year?",
    "q_9929": "Alright, well I'm going to go talk to the Doctor and I'll be coming back in to see you, OK?",
    "q_9930": "OK, so for the, when it first presented, about four to five days ago, what did you notice, notice first?",
    "q_9931": "OK, now was this with any type of activity or just at rest?",
    "q_9932": "OK, has she ever had anything like this before?",
    "q_9933": "Nothing like that, OK, and has it been fairly steady since then?",
    "q_9934": " Or has it been fluctuating?",
    "q_9935": "OK, but it hasn't really gone away in the sense that you're still concerned coming now four days later?",
    "q_9936": "Has she had any fevers at home?",
    "q_9937": "Has she had a runny nose at all at home?",
    "q_9938": "Has she seemed well otherwise, does she look sick?",
    "q_9939": "OK. And has she had any sick contacts recently?",
    "q_9940": " Anyone around her or her friends been sick?",
    "q_9941": "OK. Any recent travel anywhere?",
    "q_9942": "OK, but she's still been going to school I suppose, playing with her friends?",
    "q_9943": "OK. Have you noticed any rashes?",
    "q_9944": " Any skin changes anywhere on her body?",
    "q_9945": "OK, nothing like that, has she complained of any pain anywhere?",
    "q_9946": "OK, and has she had any recent infections?",
    "q_9947": "OK, so nothing really needing antibiotics in the last couple of years?",
    "q_9948": "And in terms of how she's been doing, has she been keeping up with her peers in terms of education, and how she moves, how she acts?",
    "q_9949": "OK, so does she have a family physician?",
    "q_9950": "OK, so they haven't brought up any concerns about how she's growing, how she's developing?",
    "q_9951": "So her weight, her height, they've been good for her age?",
    "q_9952": "Excellent. And has she gotten, has she been keeping up to date for immunizations?",
    "q_9953": "Excellent. In regards to how she's doing, otherwise health, in terms of her health, has, did she see a family physician for any other medical issues that she might be having?",
    "q_9954": "OK. How was the birth?",
    "q_9955": " Was there any complications when she was born?",
    "q_9956": "OK, so nothing when you were pregnant with her, no toxic congestions?",
    "q_9957": " By that I mean um did you drink any alcohol, smoke at all when you were pregnant with her?",
    "q_9958": "No, OK. And you just had antenatal care, so you saw doctor for ultrasounds and just for checkups?",
    "q_9959": "OK. And when she was born, she didn't have to stay in the hospital at all?",
    "q_9960": "And was she born, uh what weight was she when she was born?",
    "q_9961": "8 kilos?",
    "q_9962": "Yeah, no worries. And then otherwise she is, so she's been healthy otherwise, been doing well, uh just in terms of how she's been doing uh with other systems of her body, have you noticed any concerns for her bowel movements?",
    "q_9963": "OK, any concerns for peeing?",
    "q_9964": "And we already talked, she hasn't had any fevers, when she coughs does she ever bring anything up?",
    "q_9965": "OK, and when she's having these wheezy episodes, do you ever notice that she looks like she's really straining to breathe, really struggling?",
    "q_9966": "OK, so these usually recover on their own?",
    "q_9967": "You don't give her anything for it?",
    "q_9968": "OK, uh does she have any allergies?",
    "q_9969": "OK, do you give her anything for seasonal allergies?",
    "q_9970": "OK, so she doesn't have any allergies where her face swells up or she has trouble breathing?",
    "q_9971": "OK, and this, these episodes mainly happen when she's playing with friends, so do they happen in a certain environment?",
    "q_9972": " Like for example, is this in a friends house or is this outdoors or has it been across different settings?",
    "q_9973": "And do these episodes ever happen in your home?",
    "q_9974": "And what's the context from them happening in your home?",
    "q_9975": "OK, so she doesn't have any symptoms at rest?",
    "q_9976": "And she doesn't have any symptoms at night?",
    "q_9977": "OK. And did she wake up at night with that or just?",
    "q_9978": "OK. Alright, so we already talked about, so she doesn't really have any past medical issues that she's seen a doctor for, uh any surgeries?",
    "q_9979": "OK. Is she taking medications right now?",
    "q_9980": "Aside from the occasional Reactine?",
    "q_9981": "And she's in school?",
    "q_9982": "OK, and does she live with you?",
    "q_9983": "OK, do you two live in a house in town?",
    "q_9984": "OK, and what do you two do for work?",
    "q_9985": "OK, excellent, and this is a question we just ask everyone, has there ever been any CC CAS involvement in the family?",
    "q_9986": "And does anyone smoke in the household?",
    "q_9987": "OK, uh do you keep any carpets or pets in the household?",
    "q_9988": "So no pets, no dogs?",
    "q_9989": "OK. Any wood burning fireplaces, stoves in the household?",
    "q_9990": "And changed your air filters?",
    "q_9991": "Alright, excellent, so I think I have all the information I need, we're just going to do a physical exam and then I'm going to go talk to the physician and I'll come in and see your daughter and we'll talk about next steps from there. Do you have any questions that you'd like me to direct to him before that happens?",
    "q_9992": "OK, for sure. So you said it started about 3 days ago. Have you noticed it's been getting better, worse or about staying the same?",
    "q_9993": "OK, was there anything that happened 3 days ago that you can recall where you first noticed it?",
    "q_9994": "OK and when it came on three days ago, what were you doing?",
    "q_9995": "OK, now when you're walking, you say you have some chest tightness, do you have any chest pain?",
    "q_9996": "OK, did you feel anxious or sweaty or the feeling of impending doom at all?",
    "q_9997": "Nothing like that, OK, and did you feel yourself becoming out of breath at all?",
    "q_9998": "OK, and was this tightness all across your chest or was it in one particular area?",
    "q_9999": "OK. And since then, that happened when you were out for a walk, how many times does it happen a day would you say?",
    "q_10000": "OK, so it's been there pretty constantly for the past three days, but it's more noticeable, if not worse, when you're going for a walk?",
    "q_10001": "OK. Have you had any cough at all in the last little while?",
    "q_10002": "OK, any fevers?",
    "q_10003": "OK, any night sweats, so waking up and the sheets are soaked?",
    "q_10004": "Any chills?",
    "q_10005": "Any unexplained weight loss at all?",
    "q_10006": "OK, and have you ever had anything like this happen to you before?",
    "q_10007": "OK, so you have asthma, do you use any puffers at the moment?",
    "q_10008": "OK, so you don't have any anymore of the as needed, but you have used it in the past?",
    "q_10009": "OK. And you haven't stopped taking the daily one in last three days either?",
    "q_10010": "OK, uh, what makes you say you haven't really needed the one at night?",
    "q_10011": " Have you just been doing well without it?",
    "q_10012": "OK, understood. And then have you had, I should have asked, do you work currently?",
    "q_10013": "OK, got it. I suppose just, has this kind of chest tightness stopped you from doing activities that you normally would do, any missed time from work?",
    "q_10014": "So it's really not stopping too much of your day to day functioning, but it's noticeable?",
    "q_10015": "OK. Now, is there any other issue that you see your doctor regularly for aside from the asthma?",
    "q_10016": "OK, how about we just talk about your medications a little bit?",
    "q_10017": " What are you taking currently?",
    "q_10018": "OK understood, so aside from the high blood pressure you're really not taking medications for much else?",
    "q_10019": "OK. Do you have any other lung issues or any trouble with your lungs in the past?",
    "q_10020": "OK, got it, and just in terms of your life itself, so do you smoke at all?",
    "q_10021": "OK, so no smoking, any other recreational substances, drugs?",
    "q_10022": "OK, got it. Any allergies that you have?",
    "q_10023": "OK, and so nothing new in the environment?",
    "q_10024": " You haven't changed where you've been living or you haven't introduced a new pet or a new dog?",
    "q_10025": "OK. Alright John, I think I've got most of the information I need just to go talk to the doc and talk about your story. Next of course we're going to do a quick physical exam, going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations. I have a feeling that this actually might be your asthma reoccurring in some capacity or that would be on the top of the differential for now, barring any other new findings. So I think maybe what we would like to do is, we'd like to try having those rescue puffers available to see if that helps at all when you are on walks, and if they don't help, then we'll come back to the table and see what other possible directions we could head in in order to help you next. Does that sound good John?",
    "q_10026": "No, it sounds well, I suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise, more sounds like a chest tightness, and you haven't had any pain associated with it, so that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential. But of course we're going to try one thing at a time, and then we'll come back to the table um depending on how you're feeling after that, OK?",
    "q_10027": "OK, so sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it?",
    "q_10028": "OK, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me, is it quite swollen or engorged?",
    "q_10029": "OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?",
    "q_10030": "This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?",
    "q_10031": "OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid. And just in terms of your symptoms, so you say you've had a bite in the past and you you've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash, do you have that rash now?",
    "q_10032": "OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain?",
    "q_10033": "Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?",
    "q_10034": "OK, and you removed that twit tick once you found it, you presented to me, have you checked your body for any other possible bites?",
    "q_10035": "That's good. And did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening?",
    "q_10036": "OK, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed?",
    "q_10037": "OK, and what geographic area were you in um when you were hiking?",
    "q_10038": "OK. I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?",
    "q_10039": "OK, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health?",
    "q_10040": "OK, are you taking and medications for that?",
    "q_10041": "OK, got it. And do you have any allergies?",
    "q_10042": "So no drug allergies?",
    "q_10043": "OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease. But aside from that you've been feeling well otherwise?",
    "q_10044": "OK. So no headaches?",
    "q_10045": "Nothing like that?",
    "q_10046": "OK, excellent, alright. I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today. Do you have any questions for me Jean?",
    "q_10047": "No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, we'll come back and talk to you, OK?"
