And so, if so, it's really supportive care and unless he decompensate's and becomes really short of breath and worse, in which case we could, the treatment would be steroids and uhm, possibly utilizing other other things as well, depending on his symptoms, but usually it will be steroids and maybe some oxygen as well.

Uhm, we can get his temperature, get his oxygen oxygen saturation right away we'll get a chest x-ray. We'll do some blood work as well and uhm, he might need to be admitted depending on uhm, the oxygen, oxygen saturation and the fact that he's grunting. So if he's admitted will give him some extra oxygen and keep monitoring him and keep him hydrated. Uhm we'll also give him some antibiotics if, if it turns out he has pneumonia.

Was there anything else that I maybe forgot about that you wanted to mention?"}, {"patient": "Uhm no, I think that those are all the questions I had and everything was covered.", "doctor": "OK, uhm so uh, the next steps for now, I think, will be to, uh start, we'll get a physical exam in and your vital signs and get some investigations. It is sounding like a COPD exacerbation with the increasing and the change changing sputum. The increasing frequency of cough and the exertional shortness of breath as well, along with wheezing and kind of this chest discomfort that you're experiencing. And so, uh, this will require some antibiotics as well and depending on the severity of symptoms, possibly some steroids as well to help with the inflammation."}]}

And with your exposure to your brother who also received antibiotics, could be potentially be a sick contact for you that you were around, so this would require antibiotics as well for yourself and we'll do a rapid strep antigen test to check for this and wait on the result for that because it it still could possibly be a viral illness and so that passes negative and we're thinking it's a viral illness then we might hold off on antibiotics for now and monitor symptoms. And if at any point things get worse like you start to get shortness of breath or your fever's getting worse and it's not, not being controlled, then we'll reeassess the situation."}, {"patient": "OK, sounds good.

She may require some antibiotics like she has had before, but that will depend on what. I see on physical examination she has been having a fever so she might. And it's only been three days, right?

Or ear drops."}, {"patient": "OK.", "doctor": "Uh, but yeah, so we'll do the examination and then go from there.

So for that we will start off with some basic blood work like CBC, electrolytes, your kidney function, ABG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, as well as like a chest X Ray. And basically we should treat it we're going to take your oxygen saturation an give you some extra oxygen if you need. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to use your bronchodilators an and in addition to both of that will also give you some steroids as well as antibiotics. And just to prevent any infections or if you already have it then it can help with that as well. And because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid will also do a covid swab just to make sure it's not that. And you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours.

Is it the same way better?"}, {"patient": "Um the, well, I guess it's getting worse, yeah.", "doctor": "Do you feel like it's all the time or is it on and off?"}, {"patient": "It's it's just there all the time.", "doctor": "Have you ever had any difficulty breathing in the past?"}, {"patient": "Um no no, no, not like this.", "doctor": "OK.

Do you know if your immunizations are up to date?"}, {"patient": "Ah yes, everything's up to date.", "doctor": "OK. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good. See you so I'm just gonna ask you about a few other symptoms. I just like to get an idea if there's anything else you been experiencing. Have you had a cough at all?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Have you had a runny nose?"}, {"patient": "No runny nose.", "doctor": "Have you had any headaches?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Have you had any chest pain?"}, {"patient": "Ah nope, no chest pain.", "doctor": "Have you have you lost any of your sense of smell or taste?"}, {"patient": "Um maybe taste a little bit but not smell.", "doctor": "OK, OK, when did that start?"}, {"patient": "The taste ah. Maybe two days ago?", "doctor": "OK. OK taste two days ago. Has it been on and off or has it been kind of constantly like a reduced sense of taste?"}, {"patient": "It's it's. It's been pretty constant.", "doctor": "OK. Have you had anything like that before?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Have you had any fevers?"}, {"patient": "I don't think so.", "doctor": "OK. Have you had any chills or night sweats?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Have you felt overall really tired and weak?"}, {"patient": "I. I felt tired, maybe not weak, but my I feel like my muscles all ache.", "doctor": "OK. OK, and when did that start?"}, {"patient": "That started. Like immediately after my sore throat.", "doctor": "OK. OK. OK, well we might circle back. I think there is any more questions you want to ask. Right now, but just in general, in terms of your overall health, do you have any chronic conditions that you take medications for or see a doctor for regularly?"}, {"patient": "Um I have mild COPD.", "doctor": "OK. And what medications are you currently taking?"}, {"patient": "Um I'm on a long acting beta agonist.", "doctor": "OK, is that the only medication you take?"}, {"patient": "Pardon me.", "doctor": "Is that the only medication that you take?"}, {"patient": "And I also take a couple of vitamins.", "doctor": "OK.

And do you have any family history of respiratory problems, heart problems and?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK. Uhm. OK, I think that that about covers my questions for you right now. Is there anything else that you wanted to add that I didn't ask you about?"}, {"patient": "Um no, I don't think so.", "doctor": "OK. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to go over this with the document I'm working with today, I'm guessing just because some of your symptoms are in line with common symptoms of covid 19, that will probably do a covid swab, and what happens with that is since we do have some syptoms, will have to isolate until the result come back and potentially after that if you still have symptoms, even if it is negative. So that's just kind of a heads up on that. Maybe one of the next things that happens. We will probably get you a chest xray 'cause we want to get an idea of what's going on in there. Did you have any other questions?"}, {"patient": "No, thank you very much.", "doctor": "OK well thanks for chatting with me we should be back shortly to kind of let you know with the next step."}, {"patient": "OK, great, thank you.", "doctor": "Thanks."}]}
{"id": "RES0202", "conversation_pairs": [{"patient": "Hi. So I just brought in my son he's 5. Essentially, when he, so today is Friday when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but he I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough, but obviously I just wanted to keep him home, keep him safe and not like spread anything if he was sick. So he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. Then yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired, uh sorry. Today, today is Friday. He was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today, what was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember it was it was. It was like over 100 though.", "doctor": "Oh OK."}, {"patient": "Uh, 101 or something or maybe 100.1 if. But anyways it was so I I just thought I should probably bring him in 'cause I was really worried about him and you know so he could have maybe got covid and like at school or something.", "doctor": "Yeah for sure. Um OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five five days."}, {"patient": "Mhm.", "doctor": "OK, OK so let's focus on the cough."}, {"patient": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Friday. Its been more like like 3 days.  Wednesday is when he came home, and then um he. And then today is Friday. So yeah, sorry.", "doctor": "Today is Friday OK. And um. OK, yeah sure uh so. Is this cough a productive cough, or is it kind of a dry cough?"}, {"patient": "Uh I think it's dry. I haven't noticed him like spitting up anything. Yeah he yeah, its just like little cough.", "doctor": "OK, And. He is he. He's not bringing up any sputum or blood?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No OK good. OK, and does he sound wheezy at all to you?"}, {"patient": "No, no, not that I've noticed.", "doctor": "OK, how about short of breath?"}, {"patient": "Um I don't think so like he usually he's a really active kid and he has. He hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple of days, so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing. But also I think he's just been tired in general.", "doctor": "OK, yeah. OK, Uhm. Is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day? Like is it worse at night, in the morning?"}, {"patient": "Mm I think it kinda just there the whole day.", "doctor": "OK, and it does it, how does it sound? Does this sound like a barky cough? Does it sound? Uhm? Like harsh, what is what would you say the quality of it, of the sound of the cough is?"}, {"patient": "Uh, I, just sounds kind of dry. It's not like super loud.", "doctor": "OK. OK, and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past?"}, {"patient": "Um like he's had colds before, but I haven't like. I haven't like you this time he kind of had the fever, which is different than you know, having a regular cold.", "doctor": "OK. And are his symptoms getting worse?"}, {"patient": "I think so 'cause yeah, the first day he just seemed like a little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he actually has a fever.", "doctor": "OK, and is he complaining of anything like chest pain? Or feeling like his heart's racing?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't think so.", "doctor": "No, OK. Does he have a sore throat?"}, {"patient": "Mm I don't think so.", "doctor": "OK, and is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids?"}, {"patient": "I don't know if he's having trouble swallowing, but he doesn't seem to have a big appetite right now.", "doctor": "OK, and is he, does he have a blocked nose or runny nose?"}, {"patient": "Maybe a bit of like a look at runny nose.", "doctor": "OK, and does he have any issues with smell or taste?"}, {"patient": "He, this morning he really seemed like he wasn't like into his breakfast and I wonder if he's losing his sense of taste a little bit.", "doctor": "OK, how about vision or hearing?"}, {"patient": "I think those are fine.", "doctor": "OK, and is he complaining of any chills or night sweats?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, any changes in his hair, nails or skin like rashes?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't noticed anything like that.", "doctor": "Any changes in his bowel movements. Pardon?"}, {"patient": "Um sorry no changes.", "doctor": "OK, no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool?"}, {"patient": "No", "doctor": "OK, any nausea or vomiting?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, any changes in his urine?"}, {"patient": "I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really been looking, but I don't think so.", "doctor": "Any dizziness or fainting spells?"}, {"patient": "No, just like fatigue.", "doctor": "OK, any confusion or memory loss?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "And is he and is he an otherwise healthy child?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, actually he hasn't decided to like a vaccine that he hasn't had to go to the doctor like ever like. I mean, he broke his arm once, but that was it.", "doctor": "OK, um so no past illnesses and I guess no hospitalizations or surgeries except for the broken arm."}, {"patient": "Exactly, like nothing.", "doctor": "OK, and were things normal with your pregnancy with him?"}, {"patient": "Yeah totally.", "doctor": "OK um. And then how about as a newborn, any complications after birth?"}, {"patient": "No, no, like everything is things really good.", "doctor": "OK, and then did he hit all his milestones up till now?"}, {"patient": "Yeah totally.", "doctor": "OK. Any, does he have any allergies?"}, {"patient": "Um. No, no, I don't think so. I mean like he hasn't really taken a lot of medicine, so it's hard to say, but like nothing.", "doctor": "Is he up to date with all his immunizations?"}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "Yeah OK. And. In terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?"}, {"patient": "Uh no everyone is really healthy.", "doctor": "OK, and. And are there and who does he live with and where does he live?"}, {"patient": "Um he lives with just me and my husband, and he has a little sister, like this in town here.", "doctor": "OK and, is she healthy?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I think she, yeah she's healthy.", "doctor": "OK um? Any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No, OK. Has he been around any sick contacts recently?"}, {"patient": "Not, not like outside of school. I like we know for sure, not outside of school, um but he goes to school right now so. Kinda hard to say.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "But they haven't. They haven't like contacted us about anything.", "doctor": "OK, sure. And has he traveled anywhere recently?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?"}, {"patient": "I don't think so. Um, like I, I realized that I can often times like you don't really do much for kids when you know when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess need to have a covid test to go back to the school, even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say. It's like the other kids have had an exposure.", "doctor": "Yeah for"}, {"patient": "yeah, like. Sorry, go ahead,", "doctor": "No go ahead."}, {"patient": "I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just basically wanted to see if it was bad. I mean he doesn't receive your so scared. That's kind of what makes him in like it's gonna be a little bit.", "doctor": "Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a covid swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Um we do suggest because his symptoms are allowed with symptoms of covid that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister possible. And then if the swab comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays, and if his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms, like seizures or. If he's feeling weak, dizzy if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and. And so for now I'll just wait for those covid swaps to come back. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, sounds good.", "doctor": "OK great yeah, yeah no worries and. I I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add other things like asthma to the list of things he could be worked up for, but um right now it sounds like it sounds like an infection."}, {"patient": "OK yeah, that's good to know.", "doctor": "Alright, sounds great. Have a good day."}]}
{"id": "RES0203", "conversation_pairs": [{"patient": "Yeah, so for the past two days I I've I've noticed that I can't smell things as well, as I used to be able to smell them and I seem to have lost my sense of taste as well.

You said for a couple days?"}, {"patient": "Yes, for two days.", "doctor": "OK, have you ever had anything like this before?"}, {"patient": "No, no, nothing like this.", "doctor": "OK, when you say you feel like you've lost sense of taste and smell, is it totally gone or do you taste a little bit? Or how? How is that working for you?"}, {"patient": "The smell isn't totally gone I can still smell something if it smells really really bad and and then and then I can taste really, really salty foods, but I can taste normal things like I can't taste of banana.", "doctor": "OK, is that been pretty consistent throughout the last couple of days or is it on and off?"}, {"patient": "It's been pretty consistent, yeah.", "doctor": "OK. And did this dry cough that start at the same time?"}, {"patient": "Yes.", "doctor": "And when you say sorry, you said mild cough, and I my next question was do you feel like it's a dry cough or you producing any sputum? Any blood? Or is it to not, not bringing up anything?"}, {"patient": "It's dry.", "doctor": "OK, has that gotten worse over the last couple of days?"}, {"patient": "The dry cough?

Are your immunizations up to date?"}, {"patient": "Yes.", "doctor": "OK, and can you think of any for this dry cough, just a circle back to that. Can you think of anything that triggers it? It's called the cold or being around certain things like cats or dogs or any other environmental things?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK. Have you had any chest pain? Thats the other thing . I'm not sure if I asked you ."}, {"patient": "No no chest pain.", "doctor": "OK. And in terms of your general health, do you?

OK. Uhm I think that's all my questions for now. Uh I definitely like to get you a covid test just because your symptoms are consistent with some common covid symptoms. So basically that means that we would do a swab. It might not come back for a day or two. You definitely have to self isolate between now and when you get the results back, potentially even if it's negative, longer, if you're still having symptoms."}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "Otherwise, there probably. There might be a couple other tests we want to do. We might have more questions when we come back, we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today, but just wanted to give you a heads up of what to expect next.

OK."}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, have you ever had anything like this before?"}, {"patient": "No. I've been pretty healthy otherwise.

Did you see your family doctor for anything? Any health problems?"}, {"patient": "No, no.", "doctor": "Do you take any medicines?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK.

Do you have any family history of respiratory problems?"}, {"patient": "Um uh his grandparents had um asthma, but he's been worked up for that and he doesn't get short of breath or wheezing or anything like that with even with physical activity. So yeah, so he doesn't have that.", "doctor": "And what else?"}, {"patient": "Pardon me.", "doctor": "I said just some some asthma in the family."}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "OK. And so you live, you live with your mom.

So what's your favorite game?"}, {"patient": "I am playing Rollercoaster Tycoon.", "doctor": "Oh cool, that sounds like fun. OK well, hopefully we can get you back to feeling healthy so you can continue to play lots of roller coaster Tycoon. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to go get the doctor that I'm working with. I'm, uh, I'm wondering, you know, he might want to do a chest X Ray and get a better look at what's going on there. Have you ever had an X Ray before?"}, {"patient": "I don't think so, no.", "doctor": "Do you know what an X Ray is?"}, {"patient": "A little bit, yeah.", "doctor": "Yeah it's like taking picture of your body on the inside. It's pretty cool so it gives us an idea of what's going on in the inside. Also, this really this part is kind of not so much fun, but I think we should probably do a covid swab because we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately and that's not a lot of fun. We gotta stick something up your nose, but I think that you're really brave and I think that you'll be just fine with it, OK?"}, {"patient": "OK.", "doctor": "So we're going to arrange for these things and then I will come back with the doctor that I'm working with and we'll kind of talk about where to go from here."}, {"patient": "OK, that sounds good.", "doctor": "Thank you guys for chatting with me."}, {"patient": "Yeah, thank you.", "doctor": "Thanks."}]}

But the cough doesn't last this long, like it's usually over in a week or week and a half or so.", "doctor": "Mm. And it's it's not letting up."}, {"patient": "Mm.", "doctor": "OK um. I'm gonna ask you a few questions about the cough itself. Is this a dry cough that you're experiencing? Or are you producing like any any mucus or coughing up anything?"}, {"patient": "There was some mucus um earlier on, but now it's it's all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dry cough.", "doctor": "Now, it's dry OK how long, what was the timeline for that? I guess how long?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, so maybe for the first four or five days there was this like whitish clear kind of mucus that was coming up and then after that was a a dry cough.", "doctor": "OK, OK. And do you feel like the intensity of the cough got worse over the last two weeks, or has it gotten any better?"}, {"patient": "Kind of the same, I would say.", "doctor": "And has the cough gotten more frequent over this time as well?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "How often would you say that you're coughing?"}, {"patient": "Uhm? It's hard for me to quantify, maybe a couple of times an hour, maybe three or four times an hour or so.", "doctor": "Is there anything you can think of that triggers the cough, or is it spontaneous?"}, {"patient": "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kinda, spontaneous um. Can't really think of anything.", "doctor": "OK. And along with the cough, are you experiencing any difficulty breathing?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, have you noticed any fevers?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, no.", "doctor": "OK um. Have you had any sore throat?"}, {"patient": "Um I did initially um for the first two or three days and then that got better.", "doctor": "OK um. Have you had any runny nose?"}, {"patient": "I did initially yeah, I have like had all those flu symptoms for the first couple of days, but the cough just kinda stayed. Everything else resolved in the first uhm three or four days I would say.", "doctor": "OK. Thank you for sharing that have you had, did you have any chest pain at any point?"}, {"patient": "No, but I guess like sometimes when I'm coughing too much my chest hurts a little bit.", "doctor": "OK, so it feels kind of sore after all that?"}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "OK. OK, have you been in contact, I guess it's hard to say because it started a while ago, but before it started bringing contact with anyone that's been sick?"}, {"patient": "I I work at the hospital, but. Um I'm wearing PPE all the time, and I'm very careful so.", "doctor": "OK.

Kind of like a green yellowy sputum uhm. I even notice that there is like a little bit of blood a couple times when I was like, really coughing hard. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been finding it like harder to breathe than usual. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have home oxygen or anything, and I'm not.

I will now do it physical exam and look at your vitals and listen to your chest. It's likely that what you have right now is COPD exacerbation, maybe just a like an infection that you got, which worsened some of your COPD symptoms. We would also have to rule out covid, so we'll be doing a covid swab and will decide based on the on your labs in your vital signs. It's instead of other things whether you need to stay in the ER and be admitted, or if you are good to go home, I will also talk to my attending and will make those decisions together and come back and talk to you.

We can't necessarily rule out covid just yet."}, {"patient": "Thats what I was worried about.", "doctor": "Yeah, and given that you're having difficulties breathing, we're also going to have a look at your chest and do it physical exam, but also do a chest X Ray just to make sure, or just to see if there's anything a infection that is settling in your chest, and a covid swab and then uh go from there. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll decide whether you need to stay in the, you need to stay in the hospital and if you can go home based on those results, but if you are to go home, we would request that you stay away from from everyone, so including your wife.

I probably smoked 5 cigarettes a day, but it used to be a little bit more.", "doctor": "OK, coming back to the stress, is there anything recently that's causing you more worries?"}, {"patient": "Um it's just that I'm I'm doing my Masters of social work and I'm getting towards the end and it's just, it's very scary because I'm working on my final uh thesis and there's just a lot involved and it's it's just making me very nervous.", "doctor": "OK, is there anything special about the last couple of weeks that's made you more stressed than previously?"}, {"patient": "Uh I think just the the time crunch of having to to finish this.

Um no, there's nothing else in my family like that. I don't really know like about my grandpa, like my dad's dad, but like he might have also, um he just kind of, he just passed away young from um like an accident. So yeah, I'm not really sure.", "doctor": "Got it, so no one has died suddenly with no explanation when they were young or while they were swimming?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No one's ever talked about arrhythmias, or is that a word familiar to you?"}, {"patient": "No, no, just my dad and his heart attack.

Anything else you feel I should know?"}, {"patient": "No, do you think I have covid?", "doctor": "It's a possibility. It's always good to rule these things out, so we'll be ordering a covid swab no matter what. Obviously with any presentation where we have someone come in with a fever and sore throat, we want to rule out anything infectious. So it sounds like if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out. So just while we're trying to investigate, work this up further, I want to have you and your husband self isolate. The other question I suppose I should ask is, have you gotten your flu shot this year?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't.", "doctor": "So it's also a possibility it might be influenza, just the seasonal flu.

So I was just, you know, worried that it could be something serious and I wanted to come and get checked out.", "doctor": "OK, for sure. So you said it started about 3 days ago. Have you noticed it's been getting better, worse or about staying the same?"}, {"patient": "I think it's staying the same.", "doctor": "OK, was there anything that happened 3 days ago that you can recall where you first noticed it?"}, {"patient": "No, nothing in particular um yeah, it just kind of came on and now it's been pretty steady.", "doctor": "OK and when it came on three days ago, what were you doing?"}, {"patient": "Uh I think I first noticed it when I was gone for my walk.", "doctor": "OK, now when you're walking, you say you have some chest tightness, do you have any chest pain?"}, {"patient": "No, there's not there's not pain, it just feels like, when I breathe in it feels tight.", "doctor": "OK, did you feel anxious or sweaty or the feeling of impending doom at all?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no I can't say that I did.", "doctor": "Nothing like that, OK, and did you feel yourself becoming out of breath at all?"}, {"patient": "Uh I I feel like it was kind of harder to get a whole breath, um so yeah, yeah, I guess.", "doctor": "OK, and was this tightness all across your chest or was it in one particular area?"}, {"patient": "Kind of just all over.", "doctor": "OK. And since then, that happened when you were out for a walk, how many times does it happen a day would you say?"}, {"patient": "Well, I feel like it's kind of always there, but it gets worse when I go for my walk. Um and well sometimes I go for more than one walk, right, 'cause I walk my dog. It's always kind of there, and especially when I'm like getting up out of the chair, I can feel it more, or when I take a big like a big breath in, as I said.", "doctor": "OK, so it's been there pretty constantly for the past three days, but it's more noticeable, if not worse, when you're going for a walk?"}, {"patient": "Exactly.", "doctor": "OK. Have you had any cough at all in the last little while?"}, {"patient": "Uh no like I feel a little more hoarse and like there's maybe some more phlegm, like I'm clearing my throat more, but I haven't actually been coughing.", "doctor": "OK, any fevers?"}, {"patient": "No, can't say that, no.", "doctor": "OK, any night sweats, so waking up and the sheets are soaked?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Any chills?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Any unexplained weight loss at all?"}, {"patient": "Nope.", "doctor": "OK, and have you ever had anything like this happen to you before?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, I mean I have asthma um so I've had some trouble breathing before, it, this feels feels uh different than other times. I I guess it could be related, but uh I don't know, this this feels a bit different, that's why I wanted to come in and get it checked out.", "doctor": "OK, so you have asthma, do you use any puffers at the moment?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I just use the one that um I take every day. I don't really use the uhm, the one thats as needed because I just haven't had to in a really long time so I didn't refill my last one.", "doctor": "OK, so you don't have any anymore of the as needed, but you have used it in the past?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, exactly like it's been a couple of years since I needed that, but I still I still take the daily one.", "doctor": "OK. And you haven't stopped taking the daily one in last three days either?"}, {"patient": "No, I always take it um so I'm supposed to actually take it morning and night, um for a while though sometimes I was skipping the night one because I didn't feel that I was needing it. Um so so lately I've been taking it everyday, but I've just been taking it in the morning.", "doctor": "OK, uh, what makes you say you haven't really needed the one at night? Have you just been doing well without it?"}, {"patient": "Exactly, like I haven't needed the rescue one in a few years and even when I was just taking it in the morning, I I haven't had any problems.", "doctor": "OK, understood. And then have you had, I should have asked, do you work currently?"}, {"patient": "Uh I I, I'm a financial advisor, I'm like semi retired so I do some stuff from home.", "doctor": "OK, got it. I suppose just, has this kind of chest tightness stopped you from doing activities that you normally would do, any missed time from work?"}, {"patient": "I haven't missed any work, but I'm not I'm not doing a ton of work right now. I don't think it would stop me, it just would make me uncomfortable um during work and it keeps me, maybe this, the last few days, it's kept me from, I usually go on a couple of walks a day, the last couple days I've just gone on one usually so yeah, it's a little bit, yeah.", "doctor": "So it's really not stopping too much of your day to day functioning, but it's noticeable?"}, {"patient": "Exactly, yeah.", "doctor": "OK. Now, is there any other issue that you see your doctor regularly for aside from the asthma?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, I have uh high blood pressure, I don't really see my doctor very much, I just am on um medication.", "doctor": "OK, how about we just talk about your medications a little bit? What are you taking currently?"}, {"patient": "Uh I take the, uh, salbutamol.", "doctor": "Yeah."}, {"patient": "That we talked about, and I take um Ramipril.", "doctor": "Yep."}, {"patient": "And, uh, sometimes a Tylenol if you know, if I have a headache or something, but not very often.", "doctor": "OK understood, so aside from the high blood pressure you're really not taking medications for much else?"}, {"patient": "No, no.", "doctor": "OK. Do you have any other lung issues or any trouble with your lungs in the past?"}, {"patient": "No, nothing major, just the asthma. But you know, like I said, it's been a few years since it has bothered me.", "doctor": "OK, got it, and just in terms of your life itself, so do you smoke at all?"}, {"patient": "No, never.", "doctor": "OK, so no smoking, any other recreational substances, drugs?"}, {"patient": "Oh no, no. I mean I I have um you know a few beers on the weekend, but I don't do very, I don't do any drugs and I don't drink much other than that.", "doctor": "OK, got it. Any allergies that you have?"}, {"patient": "Uhm no, no, like I, uh, when I was younger I got some seasonal allergies sometimes in the springtime, but other than that, I I like I, it's really been uh many years since I've noticed that.", "doctor": "OK, and so nothing new in the environment? You haven't changed where you've been living or you haven't introduced a new pet or a new dog?"}, {"patient": "Exactly.", "doctor": "OK, so sounds like you're pretty much staying the course last little while, just kind of a new onset of this new chest tightness, and aside from that, seems that it comes on mainly on walks outdoors, but you've kind of been limiting the, some of the medication you're taking for asthma the last couple of years because you haven't really felt that you needed it as much."}, {"patient": "Yeah, like just the morning was, it was enough.", "doctor": "OK. Alright John, I think I've got most of the information I need just to go talk to the doc and talk about your story. Next of course we're going to do a quick physical exam, going to take a listen to your lungs and see what else we might want to do in terms of investigations. I have a feeling that this actually might be your asthma reoccurring in some capacity or that would be on the top of the differential for now, barring any other new findings. So I think maybe what we would like to do is, we'd like to try having those rescue puffers available to see if that helps at all when you are on walks, and if they don't help, then we'll come back to the table and see what other possible directions we could head in in order to help you next. Does that sound good John?"}, {"patient": "Sounds great, I'm just, you know, glad to know that it's probably not my heart.", "doctor": "No, it sounds well, I suppose you said that you didn't really get out of breath with exercise, more sounds like a chest tightness, and you haven't had any pain associated with it, so that puts more cardiac ischemic pictures kind of lower on the differential. But of course we're going to try one thing at a time, and then we'll come back to the table um depending on how you're feeling after that, OK?"}, {"patient": "Sounds great, thank you.", "doctor": "No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, I'll be back with you in a moment."}]}
{"id": "RES0217", "conversation_pairs": [{"patient": "Yes I did, it was uh it was behind my left uh knee kind of in like the joint behind where it bends. Um it was stuck pretty good, it's still kind of red and tender there. I noticed it because the back of my knee was starting to just feel a bit sore, um not the joint itself, but just kind of the skin, the whole area back there. Um and I found this tick, I brought I brought it in with me if you wanted to have a look at it, um it's in like this little plastic container, uh and I don't really know when I got it. I was hiking on Friday um and then Saturday I was out in my garden, I hope they're not around my house, I hope that it was from hiking um and not gardening, but uh I did spend a lot of time outside on Saturday as well.", "doctor": "OK, so sounds like it's been a little bit of time since you were last outdoors to when you first noticed it?"}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "OK, so when you picked it off the tick, obviously you have it for me, is it quite swollen or engorged?"}, {"patient": "It's not too bad, um I I have actually had a tick in the past and this is a long time ago and um maybe like 10 years and I actually had that kind of target rash thing that they talk about. And, uh at that time I remember I had to take antibiotics for a bit. Um this um didn't look like that, it was more, it was just kind of sore in one spot, I don't think it um it was as bad as that time and the tick that time, sorry I've kind of gotten off track, that time it was quite swollen, this one was maybe a little bit, but not as much.", "doctor": "OK, so just in terms of the tick's size, it doesn't look like it's been feeding for too long, so when ticks uh are feeding they tend to engorge, they tend to swell up, so this looks more like a tiny little bug or does it kind of look like a little grape, almost like it's been swollen up with blood?"}, {"patient": "No, this one, this one's pretty small.", "doctor": "This one's pretty small, OK. And I should mention that, well obviously you've had a tick bite in the past, the big concern for us is a disease called Lyme disease, which is spread by bacteria, but in fact only one type of tick predominantly is a transmission transmitory agent for it. It's called a deer tick, and its coloration, it's got a little bit of a brown butt and there's some black legs. Does it look like that at all?"}, {"patient": "I don't think so, uhm, I uh I was looking at the pictures online, I think it looks like the other kind of tick, um but I heard that, yeah, but I heard that lately now they've been considering all ticks in this area as possibly carriers of Lyme um because I think it's kind of become more more of a problem sm so that was making me a bit nervous.", "doctor": "OK, absolutely, what we can do is we can send this tick off to the lab and they'll be able to identify the species for it, but for tick bites in general, one of the key considerations is for how long it's been on your body for. So unfortunately, if you're out on Friday and Saturday, that'd mean that this tick has been on you for longer than at least 72 hours. So I think one way or another, we're likely going to have to put you on antibiotics just as kind of a prophylactic at the very least, just want to make sure that um you're not at risk of developing Lyme disease. I'm sure you've heard from the news that Lyme disease can present in a variety of ways, but it's a disease that we try our best to avoid. And just in terms of your symptoms, so you say you've had a bite in the past and you you've got that rash before, that kind of bullseye rash, do you have that rash now?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't uh as far as I know, I mean, you can have a look too. It's behind my knee, so it's not the easiest place to see, but it's uh it looks a little red, it's like tender where the tick was, but I don't see that like larger circle rash.", "doctor": "OK, that's reassuring. Now any, it'd be pretty unlikely for you to have other symptoms, but just in case, do you have any other joint pain?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Have you been feeling ill or have been feverish in the last little while?"}, {"patient": "No, no, I've been fine.", "doctor": "OK, and you removed that twit tick once you found it, you presented to me, have you checked your body for any other possible bites?"}, {"patient": "Oh yeah, I looked around and I looked at my husband too 'cause we we were just a little bit, you know, gave us a little bit of a scare, but no, there's been nothing else.", "doctor": "That's good. And did you bring a pet with you at all when you were hiking and gardening?"}, {"patient": "Uh no, I didn't, no.", "doctor": "OK, good. Any other family members you think might have been exposed?"}, {"patient": "Uh no it was just uh me and my husband.", "doctor": "OK, and what geographic area were you in um when you were hiking?"}, {"patient": "We were uh in Strathroy along the creek.", "doctor": "OK. I can do, if I remember there's a Lyme disease distribution map for Ontario and we can see exactly how that lines up to see if we should be a little bit concerned or not. Looks like Strathroy is close enough to be considered a little bit of a concerning point, so I think that we will be moving forward with antibiotics, but of course we'll be talking to the physician who'll be having a look at you as well. So it sounds like you haven't been having too much symptoms aside from you've noticed this tick, the skin around it is fairly sore and you've had this in the past, but you were treated with antibiotics in the past and since then you haven't had too many health problems after that?"}, {"patient": "No, no. I've been pretty healthy.", "doctor": "OK, and just about your health right now, is there anything that you see the family physician or doctor for in general and regarding your health?"}, {"patient": "Uh just for my cholesterol.", "doctor": "OK, are you taking and medications for that?"}, {"patient": "Uh Yeah, I take a uh statin, can't remember which one.", "doctor": "OK, got it. And do you have any allergies?"}, {"patient": "Uh no.", "doctor": "So no drug allergies?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease. But aside from that you've been feeling well otherwise?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, totally fine. It was just a little tender there and that's the only reason I looked.", "doctor": "OK. So no headaches?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Nothing like that?"}, {"patient": "Nothing like that.", "doctor": "OK, excellent, alright. I'm fairly happy with what we talked about today. Do you have any questions for me Jean?"}, {"patient": "No, this is pretty well what I expected today, so thanks for helping me out.", "doctor": "No problem. OK, I'll go talk to the doctor, we'll come back and talk to you, OK?"}, {"patient": "Great, thanks.", "doctor": "Thanks Jean."}]}
