So it sounds like he's had a fever, no cough, a sore throat. So the first thing that we want to check to see or to rule out would be a strep throat and then well if that comes back negative we will go from there and think about other viral causes versus strep throat as well."}, {"patient": "Um, no.

Anything you wanted to add?"}, {"patient": "Um, no, I think that's you covered everything.", "doctor": "OK alright so I will will go off a few, we'll try to cover our basis and get you tested for mono which I would have to do like a monospot test and we can do rapid strep test as well to see if he has something called strep throat.

I used to be able to walk at least 400 meters around the block, but now I can barely even go to the kitchen.", "doctor": "OK, is this because of the shortness of breath when you are are exerting?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, that and I just start coughing so much that I just have to sit down.", "doctor": "OK. Um, and have you been having any headaches?"}, {"patient": "No headaches.", "doctor": "Alright, and how about and how is your appetite been?"}, {"patient": "Um, I think it's been pretty much the same.

I used to have I think like 3 different inhalers but haven't had to use them for more than 10 years now.", "doctor": "OK, and what was the reason for not needing them anymore?"}, {"patient": "I just didn't have any symptoms for a pretty long time and my doc said like if I don't really need them then I could just stop.", "doctor": "OK, and have you had any recent hospitalizations?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Any allergies to medications?"}, {"patient": "Nope.", "doctor": "Any surgeries that you had in the past?"}, {"patient": "No surgeries.", "doctor": "OK, And are your vaccinations up to date?"}, {"patient": "Yup.", "doctor": "OK, and could you tell me a little bit about your social situation or living situation?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, so currently I'm just living by myself in an apartment.

Did you have any exposures for two chemicals or dusts or asbestos? Things like of that nature?"}, {"patient": "Oh yes, I worked in the steel factory for most of my working life.

I mean, yeah.", "doctor": "OK, how long have you been living where you you've been now?"}, {"patient": "So this this is like the one I'm living in is a new place, but before that, I lived in another apartment for around five years and that was a pretty old building.", "doctor": "OK, do you have any pets?"}, {"patient": "No pets, no.", "doctor": "OK um.

And anybody in the family have any similar symptoms before like coughing up blood or?"}, {"patient": "No. Not that I know of. My father passed away from a heart attack when he was in his 60s.

Possibly people anybody who's had tuberculosis or any infections?"}, {"patient": "No, I've been pretty much to myself over the last few months, so not really.", "doctor": "OK um. Was there anything that you're worried that this could be?"}, {"patient": "Um Yeah, just the blood I kind of got scared maybe I thought like you know what if it's a cancer? One of my friends had lung cancer and I I know I've been smoking for most of my life, so that's something I was worried about.", "doctor": "Um, I can certainly see that the concern and I understand where you're coming from. I think it would be very reasonable to investigate that today. So we'll start with a chest CT along with some lab work and we will get a CBC and some electrolytes, also get an ECG as well to just check your heart and we will see what what the investigations show"}, {"patient": "Sounds good.", "doctor": "OK, and um, other things that um to think about this could be, uh, also like to COPD I know it's been going on a long time, but possibly could have a pneumonia that's been lingering on, particularly if it's a fungal type of infection and as well as things like you mentioned you possibly unsure if you've had an asbestos exposure in the past and stuff like that can possibly lead to scarring of the lung, and so all of these factors will be looked into."}, {"patient": "OK, sounds good. Thank you so much.", "doctor": "Alright, you're welcome, thank you."}]}

Was there any, uh, any other questions that you had?"}, {"patient": "No, not really. Just wanted to get to the bottom of this.", "doctor": "OK for sure so um we will run some investigations and likely get a chest X Ray because it's been a couple of months that these symptoms have been going on for. But I think it could be related to your smoking and most likely um Bronc, chronic bronchitis, but we can definitely will be looking into this, and then also with possibly some pulmonary function tests as well."}]}
{"id": "RES0007", "conversation_pairs": [{"patient": "Yeah, so like a couple months ago I was in the office and they told me that I have asthma like I had it when I was a little kid and I thought I grew out of it, but apparently not, or like it came back or something so. Yeah, so they just told me to come back today. I don't really have like any issues.", "doctor": "OK, So what what brought on the appointment in the summer time or a couple of months ago?"}, {"patient": "Uh. So like I have gym class at school and my teacher justalways thought that like should be able to run faster like I'm looking good athlete but I just couldn't go much faster and I was like saying I can't really breathe when I'm running that fast. And then you know my mom was like you should probably go. We should probably make an appointment.", "doctor": "OK, and uh, when you're exercising or in gym class, do you get short of breath or do you find that you have difficulty breathing?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, yeah, like I will if I if I try to run fast. Like I, kinda can't breathe anymore. So I kind of stop or go slower.", "doctor": "OK, and how long does it take for the breathing difficulty to go away?"}, {"patient": "If I stop doing like the thing I'm doing it, I I don't know not very long like couple of minutes.", "doctor": "OK, and uh, does this happen in any other settings?"}, {"patient": "Oh, like sometimes when it's really cold outside, I'll go out and like it. My chest feels tight and just feel like I can't breathe and kind of sucks like my girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow Angels and stuff and I couldn't do it. Oh, another time, like I went to my friends house and they had like a bunch of cats I I felt like I got wheezy sound and I felt like that time it took longer for for the breathing to get easier like I had to leave.", "doctor": "OK, so you've noticed changes to to your breathing sounds? Like you've had noisy breathing before?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, mostly just with the cat.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "We don't have a cat at my house, so I didn't really think anything of it. And then I went to my friends house who had a bunch of cats and. Then at that time, I could actually hear it.", "doctor": "OK, and have you had a cough?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, I don't think so.", "doctor": "OK, And. Were there anything, was there anything that you tried besides the rest to make those symptoms go away?"}, {"patient": "Like I have the, uh um inhaler that the doctor gave me last time. So yeah, like I've been using it in gym class now.", "doctor": "OK, how many days per week are you using that?"}, {"patient": "Well, I'm a little confused now because. I the 1 supposed to use, like every day a couple times, and then there was a different one that I thought it was only supposed to be used if the other one didn't work. But now the nurse just told me that I'm supposed to use them both, so I only got the one at the pharmacy so I don't really I don't really know. I feel like a bit confused now, but I always use the 1 supposed to be like 2 times a day, the one that starts with an \"s\", um but sometimes I just do it once a day if I forget the second one.", "doctor": "OK, well um we can definitely clarify the confusion about the medications today. Sometimes, for steroid medications, those ones are required to be used daily in order to get the maximal benefit, and so will take a look at your medications and see if one of those has a steroid component in it and say and how often you're needing it. Have you been having any episodes of shortness of breath at night time?"}, {"patient": "Oh no. No, mostly like gym class like I said.", "doctor": "OK. And have you had any other associated symptoms?"}, {"patient": "Uh. I don't think so. Like what do you mean?", "doctor": "Um, so anything like like allergies like runny nose or really itchy eyes with maybe some like um tearing?"}, {"patient": "When I was around the cats, yeah. But not the other times.", "doctor": "OK. And do you ever have any rashes on your skin or or really itchy skin?"}, {"patient": "When I was a kid but not really now.", "doctor": "OK, and how about any nausea or vomiting?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK. Any infectious symptoms overall?"}, {"patient": "Ahh, I don't I don't think so.", "doctor": "OK, any urinary problems?"}, {"patient": "Uh, like. No, no.", "doctor": "OK. Bowel problems?"}, {"patient": "uh no, no. No, that's all good.", "doctor": "OK um. And, uh, any fevers or chills?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, and then how about, uh, have you been having any night sweats?"}, {"patient": "What's that?", "doctor": "So, uh, overnight when you're sleeping you wake up with either your like pajamas drenched, or your your sheets drenched drenched from sweating."}, {"patient": "Oh no.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "Um not that.", "doctor": "OK. So I just wanted to ask a few questions about your past health. Have you been, so you mentioned asthma. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?"}, {"patient": "No, no that's it.", "doctor": "OK, um, and any recent hospitalizations?"}, {"patient": "Like I broke my leg years ago but like that was just like really fast.", "doctor": "OK, and any surgeries?"}, {"patient": "Uh. Just like my wisdom teeth.", "doctor": "OK, and any medications besides it like that, including the inhalers?"}, {"patient": "Nothing else, just. Just those things and my mom makes me take a vitamin.", "doctor": "OK, and any allergies?"}, {"patient": "What I don't know like not that I thought, but maybe like cats.", "doctor": "OK, and do you have any like seasonal allergies? Do you find like in the spring or fall time or even summer that you get um like dry eyes or really itchy"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I just thought like I had a cold, but I guess like I usually feel like that in the springtime.", "doctor": "OK. And, uh, are immunizations up to date?"}, {"patient": "I think so, like I've had all the stuff that I'm supposed to. I think I don't know the names of everything.", "doctor": "OK, and so I actually wanted to ask a few questions about personal and kind of lifestyle habits. But first I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your living situation?"}, {"patient": "You know, like I live with my mom and Dad and I like my little brother.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "OK, and um, where do you go to school?"}, {"patient": "Um to to the. The school, um like high school down the road.", "doctor": "OK and in what grade now?"}, {"patient": "And, I'm in Grade 11.", "doctor": "OK, and what types of like hobbies or kind of activities are you interested in?"}, {"patient": "I like I like playing video games, I was really wanting to join the Marines and I was really trying to get into that stuff, but then I heard like you can't when you have asthma. Oh so I I kinda wanna know bout that like is that gonna stop me from doing that?", "doctor": "Yeah, so it's something that we will look into today. I'm. I'm not too sure what the details are regarding that information, but thank you for bringing that up and we'll be for sure to look into that together. And that reminded me of a question I wanted to ask earlier and so have you had pulmonary function tests done before?"}, {"patient": "Uh, what is that?", "doctor": "So essentially they'll have you kind of breathing into a tube where you'll have periods where you'll maximally inhale and then maximally exhale as quickly as you can, and you'll do different types of breathing movements so that it gets measured on a on a device."}, {"patient": "Is that like when you breathe in that the tube?", "doctor": "Yeah, exactly."}, {"patient": "Yeah, like the last time I was here like couple months ago I did that and it said that, she said that my asthma was back.", "doctor": "OK. Right, thank you for clarifying. And so, so for the last few questions about. And your personal habits. I was wondering. I understand that people in your age group might experience with smoking or or alcohol. Do any of your friends do that?"}, {"patient": "I mean, sometimes we'll drink beer like at parties on the weekend. I don't, I don't drink a lot.", "doctor": "OK, and can you tell me a little bit about your diet?"}, {"patient": "Sorry I missed that.", "doctor": "Just wondering if you could tell me a little bit about your diet?"}, {"patient": "Oh, well my mom always like makes me a lunch like I'll have like a sandwich for lunch with like you know ham and cheese or something. I'll usually have like cereal for breakfast and my mom makes dinner. It's usually like meat like potatoes and vegetables or something. I think it's like pretty normal.", "doctor": "OK, and are you currently sexually active?"}, {"patient": "Uh. Like I have a girlfriend. Just with her. Uh, like just recently. Yeah we started.", "doctor": "OK, and do you use a condom?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, yeah.", "doctor": "Every time or sometimes?"}, {"patient": "Oh yeah, every time. It's not doing that many times, but yeah.", "doctor": "OK, great and um have you had any other partners?"}, {"patient": "No, no like I had made out with other people before, but this is like the first one.", "doctor": "OK, but have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?"}, {"patient": "Uh no.", "doctor": "OK, and I know this question might seem a little bit invasive, but it's important to ask everybody. Have you had any thoughts of hurting or harming yourself?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "No I haven't.", "doctor": "OK, great um. And in your family, has anybody ever had any of these similar symptoms before?"}, {"patient": "Like may my dad, I think he maybe had asthma when he was younger, but like he doesn't really have it now.", "doctor": "OK, and any allergies that run in the family?"}, {"patient": "Mmmm, like my dad also really. Dad gets like a runny nose in the spring. So yeah, I think that's allergies.", "doctor": "OK. um. So overall, it's it's sounding like you been having this shortness of breath or difficulty breathing episodes that you're saying that it's made worse when you're exercising, out in the cold, and then around pets. And sometimes when the season changes as well and in the spring and so and then the recent diagnosis on pulmonary function tests a few months ago. So I think it would be important to clear up the medications today and try to get that better organized moving forward because it sounds like you're still pretty symptomatic with needing to use them daily currently. And so will look into that and then also the question about the Marines. Uh, interest with asthma."}, {"patient": "Yeah, thank you. I really wanna know that like that was my plan and now I'm like kinda worried I can do that.", "doctor": "Excellent."}]}
{"id": "RES0008", "conversation_pairs": [{"patient": "Yeah, so uh a couple of days ago. I just started to not feel so well and I've been having this cough and trouble breathing.", "doctor": "OK, um, have you ever had anything like this before?"}, {"patient": "I do have a, uh, cough regularly, but I mean, I, I think that's related to maybe smoking. It's something that was going on for a few years. This coughs a little bit different.", "doctor": "OK, in what way is this different?"}, {"patient": "It's been happening more often throughout the day and. And bringing up more more mucus, it seems like.", "doctor": "OK, and then you said it start started a couple days ago, is that correct?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I think like Monday, so, uh, yeah I guess like 3 days ago then.", "doctor": "OK, and since you noticed it has it gotten worse over those three days."}, {"patient": "Yeah, I would say uh today's the worst day I've continually felt um sick.", "doctor": "OK. And how frequently are you coughing?"}, {"patient": "Uh I would say maybe a couple of times per hour. I'm I'm filling up a some tissues with sputum.", "doctor": "And what does that? What does that sputum look like?"}, {"patient": "It's like a dark greenish yellow colour.", "doctor": "OK. OK, um and. Is there anything that you've changed recently in your life or any kind of things that have provoked your cough that you know of?"}, {"patient": "Ugh, no, I can't think of anything. I've been kind of sticking to my regular routines.", "doctor": "OK, and is there anything that makes, uh, makes it worse, say any position or anything that you do in your day to day routine you find makes you cough more?"}, {"patient": "Um And not really I can't. I can't think of anything.", "doctor": "OK. And, have you taken any any medicine or anything to try to help with us?"}, {"patient": "Um. No, I I've I I do have a little bit of pain so I was. I did take some Tylenol and some Advil over the last few days, but that's about it.", "doctor": "OK, Ok. Did you find that they helped at all?"}, {"patient": "A little bit yeah, but it would just kind of take the edge off of the pain for a little bit and it came back.", "doctor": "And what kind of pain is it that you're experiencing?"}, {"patient": "Um, it's kind of a a sharp pain over on the like the right side of my chest like maybe belly area.", "doctor": "OK, OK um the right side of your chest and belly area. Yeah OK, so is that pain, is it, did it start around the same time as the cough?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I think it, it might have started a little bit after.", "doctor": "OK, and is this a pain that you've ever had before?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't had anything like this happen before.", "doctor": "OK. Is the pain primarily there when you cough or is it present at all times?"}, {"patient": "I would say more so when I cough or if I'm like taking a big breath. Um yeah, kind of after after I have a coughing episode I take a deep breath and I really will feel the pain then.", "doctor": "OK, and and um, you said that it's a sharp pain?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, yeah, more of a sharp pain.", "doctor": "OK, OK, and is it any worse when you're doing activity, like when you're up and walking around?"}, {"patient": "No, don't notice it with any any activity.", "doctor": "OK. OK, um an since uh, since this coughing and this this right sided pain that you're talking about began, have you noticed any fevers?"}, {"patient": "I think, yeah, I've been hot the last few days and I I checked my temperature earlier today and it was like 38.6 so that was one of the reasons why I wanted to come in actually.", "doctor": "OK.

{"id": "RES0013", "conversation_pairs": [{"patient": "I'm I'm 50 I'm gonna be 50 soon.", "doctor": "OK, OK, when did this start?"}, {"patient": "Well, like last night I kinda had like an ache on my chest, kind of like here like on the left. I just I didn't do anything really last night and you know I just went to sleep and I got to sleep fine like I just thought maybe I pulled a muscle on this side. But then I woke up and I was like walking up the stairs and I like was kinda having a hard time breathing and I took some Tylenol. It didn't really do anything. Um, and then it just got worse and then a few hours ago is like I could barely walk. And if I'm breathing deep it's like it just hurts. And I feel like I can't like catch my breath like I can't get a good like a good breath in.", "doctor": "Um, OK, so I just want to state at this point I would do ABC's, like I would do the vitals and make sure you're stable and then do airway breathing circulation if you weren't before I continue with the history. OK, so. OK, so that's how it started. Um, are you having any chest pain at all associated with that?"}, {"patient": "Like when I breathe in, I get like and it's like an ache. And then if I breathe really deep it feels like a little sharp.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "I have never had anything like this before.", "doctor": "No? OK, that was going to be my next question. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is your shortness of breath, 10 being the worst?"}, {"patient": "Um, I don't, I don't know, um. Like I can breathe right now, I can't get like a deep breath, like...", "doctor": "Does it? Oh sorry, go ahead."}, {"patient": "Maybe like you know five or six.", "doctor": "OK, OK. Does it hurt when you take a deep breath in?"}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "Yeah?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, it's like it's like sharp.", "doctor": "OK, sorry, sounds like you're having some pleuritic chest pain. Do you have any coughing associated with that?"}, {"patient": "No no.", "doctor": "No? You're not coughing up any blood?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Any swelling in your legs?"}, {"patient": "I I don't think so.", "doctor": "No? OK, how about on exertion? Like when you walk or run, or you know, does it hurt more or does I mean sorry, does your shortness of breath get worse?"}, {"patient": "Oh yeah, it was like going up the stairs, can't really breathe in after.", "doctor": "OK, how about when you're laying down?"}, {"patient": "I don't know. I don't think that's any different. No, I slept fine last night. I got up and when I went up the stairs I was like holy...", "doctor": "OK. How about wheezing? Are you experiencing any wheezing?"}, {"patient": "I don't think so.", "doctor": "OK, how about fevers or chills?"}, {"patient": "No, not that I've noticed, no.", "doctor": "OK. Any abdominal pain?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, no, it's like it aches kind of it, but it's all up here and like kind of in my back a little bit.", "doctor": "OK and, do you think anything triggered this?"}, {"patient": "I don't know.", "doctor": "No? OK. And you said this has never happened to you before, right?"}, {"patient": "Right, yeah.", "doctor": "Does it get better with you sitting forward?"}, {"patient": "I don't know, like I, I feel like that it's still kind of aching like it doesn't, it's not really like changing very much.", "doctor": "OK. OK. OK, any changes in your vision, hearing or smell?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No? Any rashes?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No? Weight loss?"}, {"patient": "I, I mean, I've been trying to to lose weight.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "They told me a year ago I have like high blood pressure so I've been cutting out like salt and trying to walk more.", "doctor": "OK, OK, good."}, {"patient": "So I've lost like 15 pounds but like not... Like I've been trying to.", "doctor": "OK, OK. 15 pounds, that's good. Are you experiencing any dizziness or you feeling faint?"}, {"patient": "No, just like a I can't get like a good breath.", "doctor": "OK, and are you otherwise healthy? You mentioned you have high blood pressure, anything else?"}, {"patient": "No, that's that's like it. I've never had any like chest problems.", "doctor": "OK. Have you had any investigations done for your chest like pulmonary function tests, ECG's, chest X-rays?"}, {"patient": "No, no, they just they just put the thing on my arm. But my doctors office and said that it was high. So they said to you know, eat better and I don't I don't wanna start any drugs so, I didn't do anything. I've been fine ever since.", "doctor": "OK, so you're not on any medications?"}, {"patient": "No, just yeah, no that's it. I mean I, you know sometimes take like a Tylenol if I'm", "doctor": "And do you smoke?"}, {"patient": "I, like I, smoke a little bit. Maybe like a pack a week.", "doctor": "A pack a week, OK? For how long?"}, {"patient": "Oh like since college.", "doctor": "OK OK. Um, do you smoke marijuana?"}, {"patient": "Uh. No, no and I I smoke, I'm trying to smoke less, you know, since they told me I have the high blood pressure. So I used to smoke a little more but this is this is less but not since I've been having trouble breathing. Is it, yeah.", "doctor": "Yeah, OK. Any other recreational drugs?"}, {"patient": "No no.", "doctor": "No, OK. How about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?"}, {"patient": "Oh like, maybe you know, a beer on the weekend.", "doctor": "OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?"}, {"patient": "Like I don't I think I got all the ones when I was like a kid. What else should I have?", "doctor": "OK, so like the flu vaccine every year?"}, {"patient": "Oh, I get that, like my wife, my wife makes me get that.", "doctor": "OK that's good. Any family history of lung or heart disease?"}, {"patient": "Oh like my, uh, my mom and dad have high blood pressure too, so I wasn't surprised when I heard that I did.", "doctor": "OK. OK. Um, OK so Rob, is there anything that you wanted to tell me that I haven't asked you already today?"}, {"patient": "I am really like nervous 'cause I haven't felt anything like this before. Um, like it's scary, like do you think it's like cancer or something like I don't I don't really know?", "doctor": "Um, I mean, it's hard to tell right now what it is. It sounds like it's it started pretty suddenly, um, like it started a day ago, correct?"}, {"patient": "Mhm.", "doctor": "Yeah, so it's unlikely that cancer would present itself like this so acutely, you know? And, but it could it could be a number of things like, it could be something like a pulmonary embolism, but you said you don't have any swelling. Um, but you did say you have some chest pain when you're breathing pretty, when you take a deep breath in. So I mean, that's a possibility. It doesn't sound like it's an infection because you don't have a fever or chills or any any other symptom really. And you mentioned there weren't any triggers like no trauma to the area. And then, other things could be like COPD because you which is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease because you have been smoking since college and that's basically just inflammation in your lungs that causes your airways to narrow, and so you may have a hard time breathing. So for all of these things, we first start by doing some blood work and then we'll do some imaging like a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test if indicated, and so that will give us a better idea of what you have and how we can best help you. Sounds good?"}, {"patient": "Yeah yeah, I just really want to get a good breath so yeah, whatever we can do.", "doctor": "Yeah for sure, and then in the meantime we'll keep monitoring you to make sure your vitals are OK and if we need to give you oxygen, we will."}, {"patient": "That'd be great.", "doctor": "OK, thank you."}]}

So I'd say it lasts at least one hour.", "doctor": "OK, does anything else make it worse, like dust? You know, laying down anything like that?"}, {"patient": "Sometimes when I'm near dust, sometimes when I'm running during gym class, increased activity does make it worse.", "doctor": "OK, OK. And if you were to describe the quality of your breathing difficulties, is it more like a burning kind of feeling? Is it like you can't catch your breath? What does it feel like?"}, {"patient": "I think it's more just a I can't catch my breath and it feels like my my throat is just kind of like closing off and I can't take deep breaths.", "doctor": "OK, yeah, that's scary. And one to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your shortness of breath?"}, {"patient": "It can get up to I would say like an 8 at times. It can get pretty scary. And sometimes, like I feel like heaviness in my chest too when it happens.", "doctor": "Yeah, and the coughing, has it been going on for as long as your breathlessness?"}, {"patient": "I would say around the same same time frame like 3 months, but I'm not always coughing. It comes and goes.", "doctor": "OK, and for your coughing, is it kind of like the same triggers, the cold, dust, things like that?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I would say so.", "doctor": "And do you ever have do you ever cough up blood?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't. It's mostly just a dry cough. I don't cough up anything.", "doctor": "OK so no sputum or phlegm, no?

Have you noticed swelling anywhere in your body?"}, {"patient": "No, nothing like that.", "doctor": "No? OK um, OK, how about um, does your shortness of breath get worse when you're falling asleep?"}, {"patient": "No, nothing like that. I think it's mainly just worse if I go out in the cold or I'm like running around, doing more activities.", "doctor": "Does it ever wake you up at night?"}, {"patient": "No never.", "doctor": "OK and any nausea or vomiting?"}, {"patient": "No, no nausea or vomitting.", "doctor": "OK, how about changes in your in your bowel movement?"}, {"patient": "No, bowel movements are normal.", "doctor": "How about in terms of urinating, any changes there?"}, {"patient": "No no.", "doctor": "OK any headaches?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No?

Um, is it more is it an older flat?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, it's fairly new. But one thing I did notice, I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but my flatmate actually smokes.

Just maybe like the normal amount. Like if I'm running around too much, I feel shortness of breath, but I think it just got worse over the last few months.", "doctor": "OK and then have you ever had any imaging done in the past like a chest X-Ray or investigations like a pulmonary function test?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't recall having any of that done.", "doctor": "OK alright well those are all the questions I had for you. If you didn't have anything else to add, I guess we will conclude by saying that what you have, we have a differential diagnosis for this. Um, it sounds like what you have is asthma. Since your symptoms started three months ago when you moved into a flat with your friends, and it seems like this smoking and cold is triggering that and so we'll work you up with a pulmonary function test to start and we'll see if bronchodilators will help with your symptoms. And if it doesn't, we'll also rule out other things like pneumonia or like allergic rhinitis. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, that sounds good.", "doctor": "OK, sounds great. Well, we'll see you soon then."}, {"patient": "Alright, thank you.", "doctor": "Take care."}]}

OK, um, did you have any questions or concerns? Anything you wanted to discuss that I hadn't asked you about?"}, {"patient": "Um, so yeah, this is just like my first time visiting a doctor in this country and like I was just very scared that it might be something serious, so just wanted to know what it can be.", "doctor": "Yeah, for sure. So the first thing we want to rule out is TB. Because you have recently moved to Canada from a country where it is, I believe it is endemic, so and some of your most of your symptoms fit with TB and how it presents so we just want to make sure it's not that because it is highly infectious and and we don't want it to spread. So, we can do like a AFB smear or I think they have other diagnostic work up for that too. So we'll do that first. If not, we can check to see if it's like another, another typical pneumonia, we can do a chest X Ray for that as well. If both of those turn out to be negatives, then we'll have to work you up further for other things, like COPD, or lung cancer. How does that sound?"}]}

So it'll be something that we'll be sure to investigate today, OK? But I just had a couple more questions. First, do you smoke cigarettes?"}, {"patient": "I quit long time ago, more than like 10 years ago, but I used to smoke like 5 to 10 cigarettes for around 20 years.", "doctor": "OK, and do you smoke cannabis?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Alright, do you drink alcohol?"}, {"patient": "No, not anymore.", "doctor": "OK, and do you use any other recreational drugs?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Alright, and are you currently sexually active?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Alright, and have you had a sexually transmitted infection before?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, so those are the questions that I wanted to go over to make sure I asked on history. Was there anything that else you wanted to tell me?"}, {"patient": "No, I think that's all.", "doctor": "OK, so next we'll do your physical exam and order some investigations. But currently thinking that it could be related to asbestos exposure as well as um, something called, well, it could cause pulmonary fibrosis and then also the joint pains that you've been experiencing might be another symptom that is suggestive of a connective tissue disease, and it doesn't sound like you have a family history of those, but we will do some lab work and investigations for for those including a chest X-Ray and a chest CT."}]}

It could be something like the common cold, such as adenovirus.

I don't, and sometimes especially people in your age group who have diabetes can have chest pain and symptoms that could be nonspecific. And so we will, we will check that for sure. We'll get an ECG and some lab work with the troponin and also a chest X Ray so that we can investigate for that. And also the chest X Ray could help us look to see if you have something going on in your lungs, like a possible pneumonia or, maybe a viral infection as well, which could include something like COVID-19. So we'll be ordering a PCR nasal swab as well to test for that. And so in the meantime, because we'll be doing that test, it requires self quarantine for 14 days so, if possible, that would mean distancing from your husband in the home as well for that 14 day period, but the results should come back from that test within the next several days. And and sorry, also if it is positive, we will have to notify public health as well so that the appropriate contact tracing can be done."}, {"patient": "Ok, ok well thank you very much.", "doctor": "Now you're very welcome.

Have you had any sore throat?"}, {"patient": "No, I wouldn't really say it's sore, but. Yeah, I mean we just kinda like like itchy.", "doctor": "OK. OK, have you noticed any changes to your sense of smell or taste?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't noticed any changes to those.", "doctor": "OK. Mmmm. And you live, do you live alone or with family?"}, {"patient": "I I live with family. I live with my wife and two children.", "doctor": "OK there. How are they feeling right now?"}, {"patient": "They were. They've been feeling fine.", "doctor": "OK. OK, um, so just in terms of your general health, are there any conditions that you see your family doctor for regularly?"}, {"patient": "I have anxiety and back pain. So, uh, I do get ah. Some hydromorphone for for that.", "doctor": "OK"}, {"patient": "For the back pain anyway.", "doctor": "OK. Um, and what medications do you take besides the hydromorphone?"}, {"patient": "Uh, uh, Escitalopram.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "And that we've been working on trying on decreasing the hydromorphone now over the last year. So it's a work in progress though.", "doctor": "OK, and have you ever had any surgeries?"}, {"patient": "Uh, yeah on my on my back I was in an accident a few years back. So, um. Well, that's where the pain is from.", "doctor": "OK, sad to hear that. Do you have any allergies?"}, {"patient": "Um yeah, to penicillin. I had a hives when I was a kid.", "doctor": "OK Um, OK um. Let me see, uh, so in terms of your family history. Do you have any family history of your digestive system problems or respiratory problems?"}, {"patient": "Um Yeah, no one in my families had any problems with their stomach or I haven't heard of any like colon cancer. I mean my my dad had a heart attack when he was in his late 60s, but that's kind of the only thing that I can think happened in my family in terms of health.", "doctor": "OK. And it sounds so. It sounds like you live at home with your family, do you? What do you do for work?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I I work for a tech company so I was going down to meet a potential buyer for one of our products.", "doctor": "OK. OK, and just in terms of your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?"}, {"patient": "Um yeah I will have wine. Maybe one or two glasses on on the weekend.", "doctor": "OK, do you smoke cigarettes?"}, {"patient": "Umm no but I I used to, I I quit about seven years ago.

'cause of the pandemic haven't really been hanging out with anybody.", "doctor": "Sure. Um OK, I think that's all the questions that I had for you today. So it sounds like there's probably some kind of infection going on. What it is exactly, it's hard to say. There are some cases of COVID-19 that, that are more like GI symptoms then than simply respiratory symptoms. So I think we should probably give you a COVID swab and then we ask that you and everyone in your house self-isolates for a few days until you've got it in a negative result and in a few days without symptoms."}, {"patient": "OK, that sounds good.", "doctor": "So yeah, we'll get that started for you, and otherwise, really, we want to know if it's COVID is just for infection control purposes, but I think that essentially you should be drinking lots of fluids and getting a lot of rest. And it's something that likely should go away on its own. I mean, if things start to become a lot worse and you get really dehydrated and you have fevers that you can't control with Tylenol, then please come back to the emergency Department. But I think in general it will just be kind of supportive treatments for what you're experiencing."}, {"patient": "OK, that sounds good. I'll get some Gatorade on the way home.", "doctor": "Perfect. Actually, don't go into the store. Have someone else get it for you, but."}, {"patient": "OK will do. Thank you.", "doctor": "Have a good have a good day. Thanks for chatting with me."}]}

So that was the last question that I wanted to ask about. Was there anything that you wanted to tell me that I I maybe forgot?"}, {"patient": "No, I think you covered it all.  I'm just wondering do you? Do you think it's COVID or something else?", "doctor": "Well, it's definitely a possibility with the symptoms that you're having, since they can be so non- specific for covid it can be a lot of symptoms that overlap. So with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it's pretty bad if you're bringing up some blood, it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing. So we will test for that and check a PCR nasal swab for COVID. I'm not, but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well. It doesn't sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you don't have neck stiffness, but it'll be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations."}, {"patient": "OK great, thank you.", "doctor": "Alright, you're welcome. We'll get those started."}]}

So definitely we need to get a chest X-Ray and we can even do a sputum culture to test for tuberculosis. And then based on the results, we might have to start you on like a whole antibiotic regiment if it does come back as tuberculosis. Yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll get those investigations done first and then we'll go from there."}, {"patient": "OK, thank you.", "doctor": "We'll also get some blood work done as well, so that'll be done before your next appointment."}, {"patient": "Alright, that sounds good.

When did your dry cough start?"}, {"patient": "Uh, like 3 days ago three days ago.", "doctor": "3 days ago, OK. And when did your fever start?"}, {"patient": "So I didn't take my temp, but like the other days, but like for sure this morning.", "doctor": "OK um, OK, so the cough is it always a dry cough or do you sometimes bring up sputum or blood?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, it's always a dry cough. It's really just annoying.", "doctor": "Yeah, yeah. Do you feel wheezy at all?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no.", "doctor": "No wheeziness, OK.

Just that, and, uh, eczema.", "doctor": "Eczema, OK."}, {"patient": "Tends to get pretty bad, like I don't really have any right now, but I really stay on top of it with like my moisturizers and like I always have like a hydrocortisone cream on hand just in case.", "doctor": "Yeah, for sure. How long have you had eczema for?"}, {"patient": "Oh, like when I was, started when I was like a kid and then I feel like when I was a teenager I didn't really, and then part of it as an adult I really have to take care of it or else it gets bad.", "doctor": "OK OK. Um, have you ever been hospitalized or have you had any surgeries in the past?"}, {"patient": "Uh, like when I was first diagnosed with Crohn's maybe 20 years ago, when I was like 20, I was in the hospital for a little bit 'cause I was really dehydrated and I couldn't really like, I just couldn't I wasn't feeling well at that time, but since then I've been pretty on top of it.", "doctor": "OK, that's good to hear. You mentioned you're on biologics for Crohn's disease? Are there any other medications that you're on?"}, {"patient": "Um, just like the hydrocortisone, cream on occasion.", "doctor": "Right. OK. Um, OK and. Do you have any allergies?"}, {"patient": "Ah, like I have some seasonal allergies, like ah, its ragweed, which is not like right now, is not the time for it. And like cats and dogs.", "doctor": "OK. OK."}, {"patient": "It's just like this environmental, it's not like not like the really dangerous allergies, you know?", "doctor": "Right, OK. Um, how about immunizations? Are you up to date?"}, {"patient": "I think so.", "doctor": "Alright, and in terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?"}, {"patient": "Oh, like my dad had high blood pressure, but other than that I don't think there is anything that stood out.", "doctor": "OK. And how about your smoking history?

Uhm, there's really only people I've been around. I can, I maybe I should have asked him before coming here if they like knew they had seen anyone but they were fine, over the weekend.", "doctor": "OK. Um, and have you traveled to anywhere recently?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No, OK. Those were all the questions that I had today were there was there anything else that you wanted to add? Anything that I missed perhaps?"}, {"patient": "I don't think so. I think that's it.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "You know, I hope I hope I just wanted to come in in case it was something bad because I you know I have those other health problems. I just want to make sure. Yeah.", "doctor": "Yeah, yeah for sure and I think it's a good thing that you came in, so thank you. Right now, I guess top on the list of things that you could possibly have is COVID, so we'll get you tested for that and we'll get you a swab and you should have the results of the that swab in about 24 to 48 hours and then you should isolate for 14 days regardless though because your symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID. And, and that includes isolating from your your children as well."}, {"patient": "Oh ok.", "doctor": "And yeah, and if it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year, just so just make sure you're staying hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods and getting good sleep. If your symptoms do become worse, and if they become uhm, severe like you have a really high temperature, you have trouble breathing or you have any neurological symptoms like seizures or fainting spells, please do go to the ER and seek help. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Ah yeah, I guess that sounds good. This is how it's gotta be, right?", "doctor": "Yeah, unfortunately, or yeah. Well, thank you again."}, {"patient": "No, thank you. Have a good day.", "doctor": "You too."}]}
{"id": "RES0043", "conversation_pairs": [{"patient": "Essentially, when he, so today is Friday, when he got home from school on Wednesday, he seemed fine, but he, I don't know that night he started to have a bit of like a cough. It just seemed like a little dry cough, but obviously I just wanted to keep him home, keep him safe and not like spread anything if he was sick, so he stayed at home on Thursday and he was like having a bit of a cough. Um and then, yesterday it seemed to get a little bit worse and he was really tired, or sorry it's today, today is Friday, um, he was like his cough is like getting a bit worse and I've been taking his temp the whole time and it got like a little high today. What was it? My thermometer says it was high. I'm just like trying to remember. It was it was, it was like over 100 though.", "doctor": "Oh OK."}, {"patient": "101 or something or maybe 100.1. But anyways, it was, so I I just thought I should probably bring him in 'cause I was really worried about him and you know thought he could have maybe got COVID and get school or something.", "doctor": "Yeah for sure. Um, OK, so just to clarify, he's had this cough and fever for the past five 5 days."}, {"patient": "Mhmm.", "doctor": "OK. OK, so let's focus on the cough."}, {"patient": "Sorry, it's been more like 3 three days like Wednesday is when he came home and then, and then today's Friday, so yeah, sorry.", "doctor": "Today is Friday, OK. Um, OK, yeah sure. So, is this cough a productive cough, or is it kind of a dry cough?"}, {"patient": "Ah I think it's dry. I haven't noticed him like spitting up anything. Umm, yeah, he yeah, it's just been like little coughs.", "doctor": "OK, and he, is he, he's not bringing up any sputum or blood?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No OK good. OK, and does he sound wheezy at all to you?"}, {"patient": "No, no, not that I've noticed.", "doctor": "OK, how about short of breath?"}, {"patient": "Um, I don't think so like he, usually he's a really active kid and he has, he hasn't been running a lot outside in the past couple days, so maybe he maybe he could have been having a harder time breathing but also I think he's just been tired in general.", "doctor": "OK, yeah. OK, and is his coughing getting worse with certain times of the day? Like is it worse at night in the morning?"}, {"patient": "I think it kinda just there the whole day.", "doctor": "OK um. And does it, how does it sound? Does this sound like a barky cough? Does it sound? Um, like harsh, what is, what would you say the quality of it, of the sound of the cough is?"}, {"patient": "Uh, I just sounds kind of dry. It's not like super loud.", "doctor": "OK. OK, and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past?"}, {"patient": "I don't like he's had colds before, but I haven't like, I haven't like you, this time he kind of had the fever, which is different than you know, having a regular cold.", "doctor": "OK. And are his symptoms getting worse?"}, {"patient": "I think so. Because yeah, he first day he just seemed like little dry and then yesterday is coughing and today he actually has a fever.", "doctor": "OK, and um, is he complaining of anything like chest pain? Or feeling like his heart's racing?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't think so.", "doctor": "No OK. Does he have a sore throat?"}, {"patient": "I don't think so.", "doctor": "OK, and is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids?"}, {"patient": "I don't know if he's having trouble swallowing, but he doesn't seem to have a big appetite right now.", "doctor": "OK, um, and is he, does he have a blocked nose or runny nose?"}, {"patient": "Maybe a bit of like a runny nose.", "doctor": "OK, and does he have any issues with smell or taste?"}, {"patient": "Ah, this morning he really seemed like he wasn't like into his breakfast and I wonder if he's losing his sense of taste a little bit.", "doctor": "OK, how about vision or hearing?"}, {"patient": "I think those are fine.", "doctor": "OK, and is he complaining of any chills or night sweats?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, any changes in his hair, nails or skin like rashes?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't noticed anything like that.", "doctor": "OK, any changes in his bowel movements?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no.", "doctor": "Pardon?"}, {"patient": "I'm sorry, no changes.", "doctor": "OK, no diarrhea, no constipation, no blood in the stool."}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, any nausea or vomiting?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, any changes in his urine?"}, {"patient": "Really been looking, but I don't think so.", "doctor": "Any dizziness or fainting spells?"}, {"patient": "No, just like fatigue.", "doctor": "OK, any confusion or memory loss?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "And is he an, is he an otherwise healthy child?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, absolutely, he hasn't like decide to like vaccines, he hasn't had to go to the doctor like ever. I mean, he broke his arm once but that was it.", "doctor": "OK, so no past illnesses and I guess no hospitalizations or surgeries except for the broken arm?"}, {"patient": "Exactly, like nothing.", "doctor": "OK and were things normal with your pregnancy with him?"}, {"patient": "Yeah totally", "doctor": "OK. Ah, and then how about as a newborn, any complications after birth?"}, {"patient": "No, no, like everything was things really good.", "doctor": "OK and then did he hit all his milestones? Up till now?"}, {"patient": "Yeah totally", "doctor": "OK. And does he have any allergies?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, no, no, I don't think so. I mean like he hasn't really taken a lot of medicine, so it's hard to say, but like nothing, so far.", "doctor": "Is he up to date with all his immunizations?"}, {"patient": "Yep.", "doctor": "Yeah, OK. And in terms of family history, are there any lung conditions or heart conditions?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, everyone is really healthy.", "doctor": "OK, and um, are there, and who does he live with and where does he live?"}, {"patient": "He lives with me and my husband, and he has a little sister like just in town here.", "doctor": "OK, and is she healthy?"}, {"patient": "Yeah I like she, yeah she's healthy.", "doctor": "OK an any concerns for old carpets, mold, asbestos or any environmental issues like that in the home that you're in?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No OK, um has he been around any sick contacts recently?"}, {"patient": "Not not like outside of school. I like we know for sure, not outside of school but he goes to school right now so kind of hard to say. They haven't like contacted us about anything.", "doctor": "OK, sure. And has he traveled anywhere recently?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No, OK. OK, well those are all the questions I had for you today. Were, was there anything that I missed that you wanted to chat about today?"}, {"patient": "I don't think so. Like I realized that I can often times like we don't really do much for kids when you know, when it's just like a virus or something. But we do, I guess, need to have a COVID test to go back to school, even if you know either way 'cause they want us to be able to say it's like the other kids have had uh an exposure.", "doctor": "Mhmm."}, {"patient": "So yeah yeah, like. Sorry, go ahead.", "doctor": "No go ahead."}, {"patient": "So I just wanted to basically see if it was that and I mean he does receive you're so scared. That's kind of what made me come in, like it's scaring me a little bit.", "doctor": "Right, yeah, OK, so first thing is, first we need to do a COVID swab just to make sure that he either has it or it doesn't have it and those results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Umm we do suggest because his symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID that he isolate for 14 days and that includes from his his younger sister if possible. And then if the swap comes back negative, there is a chance for false negatives. But also it could be another viral illness that's going around nowadays. If his symptoms get worse, so if he has a really high temperature, if he has any neurological symptoms like seizures or if he's feeling weak, dizzy, if he has any fainting spells, please do take him to the ER and uhm, so for now I'll just wait for those COVID swabs to come back. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, sounds good.", "doctor": "OK great."}, {"patient": "Thank you.", "doctor": "Yeah, no worries. Uhm and I should have mentioned if it was just the cough or if he was just short of breath or something like that and he didn't have the fever, we would add everything's like asthma to the list of things"}, {"patient": "OK yeah, that's good to know.", "doctor": "Alright, sounds great. Have a good day."}]}

Um and there was someone else in my office that I think was coughing in that, like last week and I I don't know, I questioned it but I I didn't actually get to talk to them and ask them, or like I don't know if they were actually sick or something. So, I might have been, and we wear masks and everything, like we're really good, but I don't know, I feel like the offices aren't like super, like the air flow's not that great.", "doctor": "Yeah."}, {"patient": "So yeah, I think that's another reason I was concerned, that I I feel like some people might have been sick and I didn't really know the whole story.", "doctor": "Right, OK, so potentially, from from the workplace then, OK."}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "And, OK, um have you traveled anywhere recently?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No, OK. Well those were all the questions that I had for you today, was there um anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today?"}, {"patient": "Uh not that I can think of.", "doctor": "No, OK. So right now it seems like, if I'm going through my differential diagnosis list for you, at the top is, the thing that we have to rule out is Covid, so we'll take a swab and send it off for those PCR results and you'll hear back either tomorrow or the day after, about the results. But in the mean time, and I guess even if the test is negative, um and you're still having symptoms, please do isolate for 14 days. Um and if your symptoms get worse, um like you know, you're having trouble breathing, uh your fever, your temperature is off the charts, um or you're having any sort of neurological symptom, please do um go to the ER and seek out help. Um if it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around at, during this time of year, um, and usually the treatment for that kind of stuff is supportive, so make sure you're staying well hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods, uh you're getting good sleep. Um and if not, and your symptoms, you know you're having a productive cough, um you're really short of breath, uh we can test you to see if you have some sort of bacterial pneumonia, and those are usually treated with antibiotics, so that's kind of the plan right now. Um so we'll just start with that Covid swab for now. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, that that sounds great. That's really what it, like, I I don't feel super sick, I just really wanna know if I have Covid or not.", "doctor": "Yeah for sure and I, and I think it's good that you came in."}, {"patient": "Awesome.", "doctor": "Alright, thank you."}]}

Uh in the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days, and that includes from family members when possible, and public health will get in touch with you if those results are positive and so they can they can do some contact tracing. If it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around, and I guess the best therapy for that is staying hydrated, um getting good sleep, and eating nutritious foods. Uh but if your symptoms get worse, like you're running a really high fever, um you're having neurological symptoms like you know seizures or fainting spells, um or if you're having difficulty breathing, um you should come back to the ER.

Um and if it's not covid, it's probably another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. Uh if your symptoms get worse, um you know you're having neurological symptoms or or if your fever gets really high, or you're having a lot of trouble breathing, then you should go see the ER.

Barky?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, I would just say it's like kind of harsh at times, but mainly it's a dry cough, like I'm not bringing anything up.", "doctor": "OK, OK.

Was there anything that you wanted to ask me or anything else that you wanted to discuss that I may have missed?"}, {"patient": "Uh, yeah, I I that I'm just wondering like I could it be COVID I I don't know. I don't know if someone in the office had it or yeah, it was just basically worried about, if I had COVID.", "doctor": "Yeah for sure. that's definitely something that we need to rule out, so we will be doing a COVID swab on you and and you will hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with the results. But regardless, because your symptoms overlap with symptoms of COVID especially umm, the loss of smell and taste, we do recommend that you isolate for 14 days and that includes trying to isolate from family members as well. So we'll, that's where we'll start. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year. But, we'll start with, we'll start with these COVID swabs.

What do you think I have?", "doctor": "Well, it is sounding like it could be most likely an infectious type of process going on with the possibility of having a fever with a cough and sore throat. So we'll do a physical exam and also some investigations which will include a covid test today. Because some of these symptoms do overlap, but it could be something like the common cold. I don't know the virus that's bringing this on but it's not necessarily covid. But because we're doing the test, it will require 14 days of self isolation. We'll get back to you with the results as quickly as we can."}]}

Any complications at that point?"}, {"patient": "Yeah he's a little pre term. 34 weeks I think.", "doctor": "OK, was he also underweight too?  You mentioned just a little bit."}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "OK, and any complications during the actual delivery?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, not that I remember like she started going to labor early, like earlier than we expected.

I don't think there are any allergies in the family.", "doctor": "OK, good, has he been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?"}, {"patient": "You know, like 5 days ago we had a playdate with his cousin.

Do you have any questions for me?"}, {"patient": "No, no that's it, no.", "doctor": "OK, well, from the sounds of it, he most likely has some sort of viral infection. We will do a COVID swap to rule that out because some symptoms do seem to overlap with COVID and we want to make sure to rule that out. So we'll take a swab. Those PCR results should come back in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, he should isolate for 14 days at home and if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection like parainfluenza, also known as croup. So for that, for any of these viral infections, actually the best treatment is to stay at home and make sure that he's very well hydrated and eating well. If his symptoms persist for three to five days or more, or if his symptoms worsen, especially if he has like a seizure or urological issues, he should go to the ER and if his symptoms do become worse, we can also prescribe him some steroids or epinephrine just to open up his airways. And if it's really, really bad he might be hospitalised as well. So just keep an eye on on that for now. And if you have any"}, {"patient": "A little scary. Sounds good. OK, I'll just keep an eye on him for the next five days.", "doctor": "Give us a call if his symptoms are becoming worse or if they're not resolving and we will try to do an assessment on him. Of course we will do a physical exam today and will let you know how severe his symptoms are. Most children will get over their infection on their own and he likely won't need any additional treatments."}, {"patient": "OK, sounds good.", "doctor": "Alright take care."}]}

So you said a cough as well, so the cough at least a week back and the shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, when did that start?"}, {"patient": "So yeah, the cough, I usually have a cough. I've had COPD for a long time, but this past week the coughing has been much worse with a lot of more sputum and. Other than that, it started I would say two to three days ago. The cough got worse and then every time I'm moving around I like have to sit down and catch my breath, which is pretty abnormal for me.", "doctor": "OK yeah, so alright. So let's focus on the cough first. You said it's a wet cough?"}, {"patient": "Yes, I am producing a lot of sputum.", "doctor": "OK, what color is your sputum?"}, {"patient": "It's mainly like clear white.", "doctor": "OK yeah so you don't see yellow pus or anything green or bloody in there?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't think so. But there's definitely like a lot more than what I usually produce.", "doctor": "OK, umm this cough, does it sound harsh, barky or does it sound muffled?"}, {"patient": "I would say it's a bit harsh at times. I wouldn't say it's barky or muffled. I do find myself wheezing a little over the last few days as well.", "doctor": "OK. Do you find you have any chest pain associated with the shortness of breath?"}, {"patient": "Oh no, I don't really have any pains.", "doctor": "OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this before?"}, {"patient": "I did a couple of years ago, I had to be admitted because I had some shortness of breath.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "But that was, I think, two years ago.", "doctor": "OK. And when you were admitted two years ago, did they tell you what you had?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, they said I had some kind of lung infection at that time, so they gave me some antibiotics while I was in the hospital.", "doctor": "OK, did they ever say to you that you had anything else like asthma, COPD, any longstanding conditions?"}, {"patient": "Yeah so I've had COPD for more than... I guess more than 10 years now so I think it just got a lot worse with the infection.", "doctor": "OK yeah alright. So this time around, have you had any fevers?"}, {"patient": "I've been having a couple of chills but like they would come and go.

I've been checking by myself at home too and it hasn't been changing too much. I think the last one I took was probably like 135 / 80.", "doctor": "Oh, I see. OK, any hospitalizations besides the one that you had for COPD a year back?"}, {"patient": "Umm, back when I was a kid I had my tonsils removed.", "doctor": "OK, are you on any medications besides the metoprolol?"}, {"patient": "I do take multivitamins.I think that's yeah, that's about it.", "doctor": "Do you take any puffers for your COPD?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, so I do have three like different puffers I take. I can't remember the name. I do have some puffers I don't take. I've been using them right now. It has been helping with some of my shortness of breath, but I've definitely been having to use them way more than I used to.", "doctor": "OK. Do you know which puffer you're on?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, so I think one of them is called ventolin. OK, and then I think the second one is called the Spiriva.", "doctor": "OK, sure, Yep."}, {"patient": "So one of them should be a short acting beta agonist.", "doctor": "Just wanna make sure that you have one with a long acting and then the other one is a long acting beta agonist.

Alright, any cancers?"}, {"patient": "My uncle had skin cancer.", "doctor": "OK. Do you know what type of skin cancer like melanoma, basal cell, squamous cell?"}, {"patient": "No, I think it wasn't the bad one. It was like the one they can remove right away.", "doctor": "Oh I see. OK, OK, that's good.Do you smoke?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I've been smoking for around, I would say the last 20 years.", "doctor": "OK, how much do you smoke?"}, {"patient": "Probably I would say pack a day for the last 20 years.", "doctor": "Umm, have you ever thought about quitting?"}, {"patient": "Yeah I did. I did once and then went back onto it. I definitely do smoke less than before though. OK, but yeah, I don't think I'm ready to quit yet.", "doctor": "OK, yeah no problem. Do you drink alcohol?"}, {"patient": "Umm, yeah, maybe once a week I would have a small Cup of whiskey.", "doctor": "OK, sure, that's fine. And any other drugs?"}, {"patient": "No, no marijuana, no other drugs.", "doctor": "OK, and where do you live right now?"}, {"patient": "Right now I live in a small bungalow in London.", "doctor": "OK, any reasons to believe there are carpets, dust, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering your COPD?"}, {"patient": "Umm, I don't think so. Everything is pretty up to date.", "doctor": "OK, have you had any contact with anyone that's been sick recently?"}, {"patient": "No, I've been mostly trying to isolate and like just be in my own home.", "doctor": "OK, how about travel to anywhere?"}, {"patient": "Nope, I've been in Ontario since the beginning of the pandemic.", "doctor": "Yeah OK, that makes sense. Well, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I was just worried if it can be COVID or if it's just like another infection that I had like before.", "doctor": "Yeah, so we're definitely going to do a COVID swab on you and those results should take about 24 to 48 hours to come back to you. And in the meantime, because your symptoms do overlap with COVID, you should isolate for 14 days. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive to do some contact tracing. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working. If we need to add any additional things like inhaled corticosteroids as well as antibiotics and so just keep an eye on your symptoms for now and will also want to do probably a chest X Ray and possibly a pulmonary function test. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Thank you.", "doctor": "OK yeah no problem."}]}

She did have a fever for one of the days and she also had a cough.", "doctor": "OK, did she get it checked out in a clinic?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't think so. She did get that COVID test done, but it came back negative and she didn't go to the doctor or anything. It kind of just went away on its own.", "doctor": "OK, any travel recently?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any longstanding medical conditions?"}, {"patient": "Just as a child. I had, probably in my teens, had my appendix removed, but nothing other than that.", "doctor": "OK.

Did you have any questions for me?"}, {"patient": "You don't think it could be COVID right? Like my wife got tested and it was negative.", "doctor": "Are you concerned about that?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, for sure.", "doctor": "Honestly, some of your symptoms do seem to be overlapping with that of COVID, especially the cough and fever. So we are going to do a COVID swab just to rule that out. So you will get those results in 24 to 48 hours and you should isolate for 14 days because your symptoms overlap. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive just to do some contact tracing. But if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year so keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse, or if you're experiencing symptoms like neurological deficits or weakness or seizures or anything like that, get help from the ER right away and if your symptoms are persisting beyond like seven days to 10 days, also you should give us a call back to see what's going on because it could be something like a bacterial infection, in which case we can give you some antibiotics. Does that sound OK?"}, {"patient": "OK, great. Thank you.", "doctor": "Thank you."}]}

Yeah, the shortness of breath has come on since then.", "doctor": "OK, well let's focus on the shortness of breath first and then we'll talk about your cough as well. So you noticed that you had difficulties with breathing sometime within the past three days. When do you find that it's difficult for you to breathe? Is there anything that makes breathing more difficult for you?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, not really.

OK, and I can see that you're able to sort of talk in full sentences.  OK, how is it making it difficult for you to do things at home, your difficulty breathing?"}, {"patient": "I am a little bit, I mean, I feel I just haven't been feeling very good overall so I've been resting these last couple of days mostly.", "doctor": "OK, and your cough, you said that started three days ago.

You're feeling tired, you have a headache, difficulties breathing, some muscle aches and you've been feeling feverish. You've also had this cough, and your nose is feeling congested. Is there anything else that that you've been experiencing over the past three days that I haven't talked about yet?"}, {"patient": "No, as you mentioned, the headache's there too, then yeah, that's everything.", "doctor": "OK, umm, alright, can you tell me about your past medical history? Do you have any medical conditions?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I have asthma and GERD I think.", "doctor": "Umm, does the shortness of breath that you're experiencing feel similar to the asthma attacks in any way?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't had any issues with like asthma attacks in a long time.", "doctor": "Do you have an inhaler?"}, {"patient": "I do but I don't use it very often.", "doctor": "I see, did you use it over the past three days at all?"}, {"patient": "Yeah I did try it and it didn't really seem to help that much.", "doctor": "Uh, and other than that, have you had any any surgeries in the past?"}, {"patient": "Uh, I had a colonoscopy two years ago.", "doctor": "Any reason for that?"}, {"patient": "Uhh, my father had colon cancer when he was in his 60s.", "doctor": "I see OK, and any hospitalizations?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK.

Anyone who's sick recently?"}, {"patient": "Not that I know of. I mean, I went to a few stores here and there that I had been going to. I've been working from home so maybe at one of the stores.

But yeah, you never, really know.", "doctor": "What about any other travels or any travels at all outside the city or the country recently?"}, {"patient": "Umm, no, I had been at home.", "doctor": "Alright. So I guess that's all I wanted to know. I'll go talk to the attending and we'll come back and do a physical exam and maybe ask a couple more questions and then discuss the management with you.

Or is this like a normal thing for you?"}, {"patient": "I mean, I guess I could have been dehydrated. I didn't even think of that, but I mean, since the food didn't taste so great, I don't know.

I usually just buy the flavored ones.", "doctor": "OK, well, you should probably look into if it has tobacco or nicotine, because neither of those are good for your health. And so we can, you know, have a discussion later on trying to cut down or quitting completely if you are open to that."}, {"patient": "Yeah, sure.", "doctor": "I'll just continue on asking you some other questions. Do you drink alcohol?"}, {"patient": "Umm, no.", "doctor": "And who do you live with?"}, {"patient": "I live with my mom, my step dad, and then my younger sister.", "doctor": "OK, do you guys live in a house?"}, {"patient": "We live in a townhouse.", "doctor": "OK, in the city you said?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, yeah, I live close.

It's usually like really clean.", "doctor": "OK, good, umm alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns that you wanted to bring up?"}, {"patient": "I guess the only thing that I was concerned about was possibly having COVID.", "doctor": "Yeah, you know, that's probably top on my list of things to investigate you for, so I would say COVID or other viral illnesses that could be going around this time of year. That would have less of a similar presentation, and so we will do a COVID swab for you. And in the meantime, if you could isolate for 14 days, regardless of whether the swab comes back positive or negative, and that would be great. If the swab comes back positive, we will notify public health and they'll try to trace where you could have caught this from and if it turns out it's not a viral illness, we will try to work you up for any bacterial infections which can be treated with antibiotics. So that's where we will start, does that sound good?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, that makes sense.", "doctor": "OK great, well have a great day."}]}

I had a cough and that sort of thing, but I haven't been sick for several years now.", "doctor": "OK. Umm, and then since you started having this cough too, now has anything changed? How are you feeling worse?

And I guess, umm, something like Reactine or Claritin for the seasonal allergies but that's about it.", "doctor": "OK. And so you said seasonal allergies. Any other allergies?"}, {"patient": "Umm, no, just usually like in the springtime.", "doctor": "OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?"}, {"patient": "Yeah I am.

Yeah, it's not much.", "doctor": "OK. But no cigarettes though?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, any other recreational drugs?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, and do you drink alcohol?"}, {"patient": "Umm, I do, yeah, I'll have like two or three beers on the weekend.", "doctor": "Sure.

I live there with my wife and three kids.", "doctor": "OK, um any concerns with your living arrangements you know, like old carpets or anything like that?"}, {"patient": "Actually last year we had most of the carpets taken out, so not anymore.", "doctor": "OK good good. Did you have any other questions or concerns? Anything that you wanted to bring up that I didn't touch on today?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I was just really worried that this could be COVID. I mean I have a cough and just have been feeling really hot so I was just concerned about that.", "doctor": "Yeah, for sure, and I think that's a valid concern. So right now I'm just going through, you know, a list of differential diagnoses that you could possibly have and COVID, it's definitely top on my list and so we will likely get a swab and run those tests and try to get that back to you as soon as we can. It could also be other respiratory infections, especially viral infections this time of the year. And so, if it comes back negative for COVID, it's probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu. So we'll go from there. And if it turns out it's not a viral infection, we will likely see if it's some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those. But it definitely sounds like there's an infectious picture going on here because of the acuteness of the presentation, and just your symptoms. So we will do afollow up in a week or so. Until then, we will run all these labs. Does that sound good?"}, {"patient": "Alright, yeah, that sounds good, so I guess I will kind of self isolate until the COVID results come back.", "doctor": "Oh yes please do so. That's that's a great point. I do suggest isolating for two weeks at least if you have any sort of symptoms, because even though the PCR that we do to test for COVID is supposed to be reliable and it's supposed to be specific and sensitive, there are sometimes false negative tests. You know, just to be on the safe side, if you're experiencing any of the symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, isolate for two weeks. But by the end of the week we should know what the test results are and then you will know for sure what you have."}, {"patient": "OK, awesome, thank you.", "doctor": "Yeah, thank you."}]}

It does get a little scratchy with my cough but hasn't been sore.", "doctor": "OK, and do you have any issues swallowing food?"}, {"patient": "No, but I haven't been as hungry.", "doctor": "OK, you haven't been as hungry. Um, have you had any changes to your taste?"}, {"patient": "No, I feel like I've been tasting my food OK.", "doctor": "OK, how about smell?"}, {"patient": "I feel like I've been able to smell.", "doctor": "OK, do you have a runny nose or a blocked nose? Do you feel congested?"}, {"patient": "Maybe a little runny, but not too bad.", "doctor": "OK, how about your hearing or vision? Any changes there?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't noticed anything.", "doctor": "OK, any pain or discharge from either your ears or eyes?"}, {"patient": "No, nothing like that.", "doctor": "OK, so let's go back to the cough. Um, are you producing any sputum?"}, {"patient": "No sputum.", "doctor": "OK, so it's a dry cough?"}, {"patient": "Yeah it is.", "doctor": "OK, any blood associated with the cough?"}, {"patient": "I haven't seen any blood.", "doctor": "OK, do you feel wheezy at all?"}, {"patient": "I haven't noticed any wheezing.", "doctor": "OK, how about shortness of breath?"}, {"patient": "Usually well, after some of my coughing fits, I can be a little bit shorter in breath, but otherwise they've been.", "doctor": "OK, any chest pain?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't had any chest pain.", "doctor": "Do you ever feel like your heart's racing?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't.", "doctor": "OK, and any night sweats or chills?"}, {"patient": "I have felt a little chilly at night, but I haven't had any night sweats.", "doctor": "OK, and how about weight loss?

Have you thrown up?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't vomited, but I've certainly felt like it a few times.", "doctor": "OK, and any triggers for your nausea?"}, {"patient": "Oh I can't think of anything. It just sort of came on. And it really went away on its own pretty quickly, but uh I don't know, maybe it was when I had my headache.", "doctor": "OK, when when did your headache start?"}, {"patient": "Um, so it's been on and off these last several days so I've been kind of resting a bit more too.", "doctor": "OK yeah, you said past several days, have you ever had headaches before that?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I've had, I think they're called tension headaches. I get those every so often and will take Advil or something like that for them, and they usually go away.", "doctor": "OK. Do these headaches feel like the same headaches?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, they they feel about the same, kind of like a pressure or vice grip on my head.", "doctor": "OK, so it's not like the worst headache you've ever experienced?"}, {"patient": "No, I think it's just been a part of how I haven't been feeling well these these last few days.", "doctor": "OK, yeah. Do you feel fatigued or tired at all?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, for sure. I haven't really had any changes, but just haven't been really getting my work done throughout the day because I have just been feeling so tired.", "doctor": "Yeah, umm, and do you feel any sort of body aches that go along with your fatigue?"}, {"patient": "Maybe a little.", "doctor": "OK. Umm, can you think of anything that may have caused your symptoms? You know, have you been in contact with anyone who's been sick recently?"}, {"patient": "I can't think of anybody I've been around who's been sick, but last weekend I went shopping in the mall so I went into quite a few stores.", "doctor": "OK, and you were wearing your mask? Everyone else was wearing their mask?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, everybody far as I could tell.", "doctor": "OK, have you traveled anywhere recently?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, I've just been home.", "doctor": "OK, I just want to ask you a few more questions.

Are you otherwise healthy?"}, {"patient": "Um, yeah I've well, I've been told I had high cholesterol so I've been taking Rosuvastatin for that the past few years.", "doctor": "OK, and is it helping with the cholesterol levels?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, the last time I was at the family doctor I was told they were at a good level. O", "doctor": "OK, good."}, {"patient": "I'm sorry I'm pre-diabetic as well.", "doctor": "OK, when was the last time you had blood work done?"}, {"patient": "I think, uh six months ago.", "doctor": "OK, and that's when you were told you were pre-diabetic?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I think my A1C was like 6.2% so uh, on the cusp.", "doctor": "OK, yeah, that's understandable. Um, have you made any sort of lifestyle changes to get your blood glucose under control?"}, {"patient": "Well, I have been walking the dog more. he weather is getting better and trying to eat out less often. Yeah, I've been trying to lose weight, but it it's been yeah, relatively stable still.", "doctor": "K, we can review some options with you later on in the visit if you would like."}, {"patient": "Yeah, certainly we can talk about that later.", "doctor": "OK, sounds good. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?"}, {"patient": "Yeah I had an inguinal hernia repaired about five years ago.", "doctor": "And are you on any medications?"}, {"patient": "Just Rosuvastatin right now.", "doctor": "OK, and any over the counter medications or herbal supplements?"}, {"patient": "Just a multi vitamin.", "doctor": "OK, umm, do you have any allergies?"}, {"patient": "Penicillin.

An yeah, that's really good. Um, do you know if you have any family history of any lung conditions or heart conditions?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't think so.", "doctor": "OK, how about cancers in the family?"}, {"patient": "I think my grandfather had bladder cancer, but, uh, I'm not sure.", "doctor": "OK, and I forget if I asked you earlier, but have you had any changes to your urinary habits, any changes in your urine itself or voiding frequency?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't had any changes there and I haven't noticed any like blood or color changes. No pain.", "doctor": "OK, great. And do you smoke?"}, {"patient": "Um, no I do not.", "doctor": "OK, how about marijuana?"}, {"patient": "Nope.", "doctor": "Any other recreational drug?"}, {"patient": "No, I just have a few beers on the weekend. Like probably I don't know two or three on Saturday and Sunday.", "doctor": "OK, and where do you live?"}, {"patient": "I live in a like duplex and rent the basement in a house nearby.", "doctor": "OK, do you live with anyone?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I live with my girlfriend.", "doctor": "OK, and um, any concerns for you know old carpets or mold or asbestos in the duplex that you're living in?"}, {"patient": "Not in our unit so I mean, maybe upstairs, but if it's anything like our place, then no.", "doctor": "OK. I think those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we end the interview?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, well  I guess I was just concerned about about COVID.", "doctor": "Yeah, you know that's the top on my list of differential diagnosis for you. So what we'll do is a COVID swab and that should come back in a day or so, but we do encourage isolation for 14 days and that includes from your girlfriend as well. So even if the COVID swab comes back negative, sometimes it can be false negative, so as long as you're having these symptoms, and these symptoms are common in COVID,  we do ask that you isolate for 14 days if the swab comes back positive. We will also notify public health so that they can get in touch with you and do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten COVID from, but other than that, if it's not COVID, it could likely be another upper respiratory viral illness because of this time of year. A lot of different viruses are going around like common viruses or the flu, you know, so it could be one of those. And then if you're still sick or your symptoms change, we can reassess to make sure it's not a bacterial infection or bacterial pneumonia, in which case we can prescribe antibiotics."}, {"patient": "OK yeah, thank you for all that information. Sounds great.", "doctor": "OK, well take care then, alright."}]}
{"id": "RES0061", "conversation_pairs": [{"patient": "I'm not so good, these last few days I haven't benn able to reallykeep anything down and not feeling so good.", "doctor": "OK, I'm sorry to hear that. Um, when you say last few days, did you mean the past two days? 3 days?"}, {"patient": "Well, I feel like maybe the last five days I just haven't been feeling so good and I haven't really felt like eating. But these last two days I've been really nauseous and I've thrown up a few times.", "doctor": "OK, when you say you haven't been feeling good for the past five days, is it that you feel achy? Do you feel hot like you have a fever, or do you feel weak?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I do feel hot and um, yeah, maybe a bit tired.", "doctor": "Tired? OK. And nausea and vomiting. Are you throwing up or just feeling nauseous?"}, {"patient": "Mostly nauseous, but yeah, yesterday I threw up like three or four times and then again today I threw up like two or three times.", "doctor": "OK, are you throwing up any blood?"}, {"patient": "No, I didn't see any red. It was mostly like yellow and umm, liquidy beacuse I haven't been eating much solids or like just like food. I've been mostly just having drinks.", "doctor": "OK, um, and so mostly fluid you said?"}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "OK, and what color is it?"}, {"patient": "Uhh, yeah, usually usually kind of like yellowish clear.", "doctor": "OK. Are you having any abdominal pain?"}, {"patient": "Maybe like after I vomit it kind of feels like squeezing a little bit. But I think, yeah, I think yeah that's just really just with when I'm heaving.", "doctor": "Right, um, are you, do you have any changes in your bowel movements?"}, {"patient": "Umm, no, I haven't noticed anything there.", "doctor": "OK. And so no diarrhea, no constipation?"}, {"patient": "No, nothing like that.", "doctor": "OK, no blood in your stool?"}, {"patient": "o blood, I haven't seen any red.", "doctor": "OK, and how about issues swallowing food?"}, {"patient": "Oh yeah, no problem swallowing. Just haven't felt hungry.", "doctor": "OK, so you don't have much of an appetite then."}, {"patient": "No, not not really.", "doctor": "OK, alright, so um, any changes in in taste?"}, {"patient": "Um, maybe I mean, yeah, I think I might not be really tasting things the same.", "doctor": "OK, how about smell?"}, {"patient": "Now that you say it, I might, uh, yeah I think my smell has been impacted as well. I can't really smell anything.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "I thought that was kind of weird, but didn't think anything of it actually until you just asked me.", "doctor": "Yeah for sure. And how about any changes in your vision or hearing?"}, {"patient": "No changes to vision or hearing.", "doctor": "OK, any discharge?"}, {"patient": "Uh, nothing like that that, but I mean my eyes were a bit, they've been a bit red these last two days.", "doctor": "OK, have they been in any pain?"}, {"patient": "Nope, no pain and I've been able to see everything OK. It's just I just noticed they were a little bit more red. I just thought maybe I don't know I was, I've just been tired.", "doctor": "Yeah for sure. Any coughing?"}, {"patient": "Uhh, yeah I haven't had a cough but um, I've had a cough for a few years now, so yeah, that's not really a change for me.", "doctor": "Alright, so no change in your cough. Is it a dry cough or a wet cough?"}, {"patient": "It's uh, oh, a dry cough usually.", "doctor": "Dry cough, OK. Any blood that you produce?"}, {"patient": "No blood, no blood.", "doctor": "OK, any shortness of breath?"}, {"patient": "I'm not really able to exercise and stuff like that.", "doctor": "OK, have any wheeziness?"}, {"patient": "Um, no, I haven't had a a wheeze.", "doctor": "OK, how about any fatigue or tiredness?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I've definitely felt a little bit more kind of groggy and tired this last week, really.", "doctor": "OK, and muscle aches to go along with that?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, bit in my like kind of upper arms and legs a little bit.", "doctor": "OK, you said you've been feeling groggy. Do you feel dizzy at all?"}, {"patient": "Not dizzy, just maybe that I'm like moving in slow motion.", "doctor": "OK yeah, any confusion or memory loss?"}, {"patient": "No, I think I've been OK.", "doctor": "OK, any rashes?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't noticed any rashes.", "doctor": "OK, how about headaches?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, these last few days I've had a bit of a headache as well.It hasn't been very intense, so, um, I'm not worried about it too much.", "doctor": "Right, OK. It hasn't been intense you said? So have you had headaches like this in the past?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I had similar headaches before I think. They come like this. Like if I didn't get a good sleep or from not drinking enough water or something, I'll kind of get a headache like this. Kind of feels like it's squeezing.", "doctor": "Yeah, that's understandable. But it's not like the worst headache you've ever had?"}, {"patient": "No, no, it's pretty similar to headaches that I've had before.", "doctor": "OK, OK, good, and are you otherwise healthy?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, well I have high blood pressure and also, high cholesterol, so I do take medications for both of those. So yeah, I take a statin and Amlodipine I think.", "doctor": "K, OK, good. It's good that you're on both of those. Do you take any other medications like over the counter medications or herbal supplements?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I've been taking vitamin D and also a multivitamin. I heard that that we don't get enough vitamin D throughout the winter.", "doctor": "Yeah, it's a great idea to take that, especially as we get older and if we live in a country where we don't get a lot of sun exposure like Canada, so that's good. And sorry before I move on, I forgot to ask you earlier if you have experienced any weight loss or night sweats recently?"}, {"patient": "No, my weight's been, uh, about the same unfortunately and I haven't had any night sweats. But I mean now that you asked if I felt more hot than than usual, maybe.", "doctor": "OK, and did you take your temperature?"}, {"patient": "Uh, I did and the last time I checked it was a few days ago and at that time I didn't have a fever, but I mean, I'm still feeling hot so I'm not sure.", "doctor": "Yeah, OK. Alright, so I'll go back to your past medical history. Have you been hospitalized or have you ever needed surgeries in the past?"}, {"patient": "Um, no. Like the last time I was in the hospital with, it was for a colonoscopy a few years ago which came back normal.", "doctor": "OK, that's good. Um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"}, {"patient": "Uh, yeah, actually got the shingles vaccine a few months ago.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "Probably closer to a year ago now, actually.", "doctor": "Oh great, OK, that's awesome and are you allergic to anything?"}, {"patient": "Just peanuts.", "doctor": "Peanuts, OK. Do you know if you have a family history of any lung or heart conditions?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, my son has asthma. But nobody in my family's had a heart problem, though.", "doctor": "OK, how about any stomach problems or liver problems? Colon problems?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, my dad actually had colon cancer. He was 70 and so that's why we went and decided to get a colonoscopy instead of just doing the immunohistochemistry test.", "doctor": "OK, yeah, that's a good idea. Um, so it sounds like you're, you know, preemptive with your health, which is good. Any other cancers that run in the family?"}, {"patient": "No, just my dad had colon cancer.", "doctor": "OK. And do you smoke at all?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't.", "doctor": "K, how about marijuana?"}, {"patient": "Um, no, I don't smoke marijuana.", "doctor": "OK, how about other recreational drugs?"}, {"patient": "I mean, I briefly like dabbled in the past at parties and stuff like that but that was when I was way younger, like in in my college years.", "doctor": "OK, what kind of drugs?"}, {"patient": "I think maybe we used cocaine a few times and MDMA, uh, but that was like a long time, probably like 30 years ago.", "doctor": "OK, were any of these drugs injected IV?"}, {"patient": "No, no, I've never done that.", "doctor": "OK, OK, that's good. Do you drink alcohol?"}, {"patient": "have like maybe I don't know a couple of drinks a week.", "doctor": "OK, that's good. What kind of drinks do you have and how much of it do you have?"}, {"patient": "Usually, it'll just be one or two glasses of wine at a time and maybe two nights a week.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "And I usually stick with red wine.", "doctor": "OK, great, and who do you live with?"}, {"patient": "So um, it's just me and my son.", "doctor": "How old is your son?"}, {"patient": "Uh, he's 18.", "doctor": "OK, and do you live in a house or an apartment?"}, {"patient": "Um, yeah, we live in an apartment. Yeah, on the 8th floor.", "doctor": "On the 8th floor, OK, any issues in terms of like old carpet or mold or asbestos in the apartment?"}, {"patient": "It's a newish building so there isn't really any carpet actually in the unit, so yeah, it's pretty clean that way.", "doctor": "OK good. That's good. So those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions or concerns that you wanted to bring up before we ended the interview?"}, {"patient": "Well, I'm just hoping to to get this sorted out and feel better.", "doctor": "Yeah for sure. So you know, right now we're thinking it could be a viral GI viral infection because of your complaints of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and fever. But it could also be COVID and we are going to have to do a swab for you and run that test because you have a lot of symptoms that overlap with those symptoms. Um, and then, so just going off of that, we'll wait for the swabs to come back. If they come back positive, we will notify public health and they'll do a trace to see where you could have gotten this infection from. And then meanwhile, we do suggest that you isolate for two weeks so that you don't spread the illness, and even if the swab comes back negative, there is still a chance that you may have COVID and it's a false negative test. So we'll start there. If it turns out you don't have any of those viral illnesses and you have more of a, you know, bacterial picture, we can work you up for that and prescribe antibiotics. So that's where we will start. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, that sounds like a great start. Thank you.", "doctor": "Alright, great."}]}
{"id": "RES0062", "conversation_pairs": [{"patient": "Well, I've had this cough but the biggest issue is that I've been really short of breath.", "doctor": "OK, um, when did the cough start?"}, {"patient": "I would say about 3 days ago.", "doctor": "Three days ago, OK, and uh, around that time did you also start feeling short of breath?"}, {"patient": "Uh, the shortness of breath has come on, I don't know within the last day or so. It's come on after that, the cough started first.", "doctor": "OK, and the cough, is it a dry cough or is it a wet cough?"}, {"patient": "Well, I've been bringing up some yellowish green, kind of like phlegm, so um I guess a wet cough.", "doctor": "OK, so yeah, yellowish green you said."}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "OK, any blood in the sputum?"}, {"patient": "I haven't noticed any blood.", "doctor": "OK, and how much sputum are you coughing up each time? Like is it kind of the size of your fingertip or does it fill your whole palm?"}, {"patient": "Um, yeah, probably more like the size of like a thumb tip.", "doctor": "OK, OK um, and do you notice any, like pus or froth in the sputum?"}, {"patient": "Nothing like that I noticed.", "doctor": "OK, and if you were to describe the sound of your cough, does it sound like it's barky or like a hacking cough?"}, {"patient": "I don't know, I guess hacking.", "doctor": "Alright, and do you hear any wheezing at all?"}, {"patient": "No, well, maybe I guess when I'm really short of breath, yeah, wheezing, yeah.", "doctor": "OK, and the shortness of breath, how severe is it? 1 to 10, 10 being the worst?"}, {"patient": "Maybe a 7?", "doctor": "At seven OK, are you having issues sleeping because of your shortness of breath?"}, {"patient": "Uh, well I can't tell if it's that or the cough. I mean between those two things it's been definitely interrupting my sleep.", "doctor": "OK, and do you find there are any triggers to your coughing like like um, a particular time of the day? Triggers like you know pollen or things in your environment like pets?"}, {"patient": "No the cough has been kind of going on all day. Um, right when I get up in the morning and goes on all night, it's been getting worse to these last few days.", "doctor": "OK yeah, um yeah, that doesn't sound great in terms of your shortness of breath. Do you find that certain positions make it worse? Or like exerting yourself makes it worse?"}, {"patient": "Um, not really.", "doctor": "OK, and have you ever experienced anything like this in the past?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't.", "doctor": "OK.

And I do take Metoprolol for that.", "doctor": "OK, how long have you had A. fib?"}, {"patient": "It was like 4 years ago I think it was. It was having that like, felt like my heart was racing you were asking about earlier and they did an ECG and I was told I had atrial fibrillation. So yeah, I've been on a beta blocker for three years now.", "doctor": "OK, four years, and when was the last time you had an ECG?"}, {"patient": "Uh, maybe just a couple of months ago. I think every time that I come in to see my family doctor, they they do one.", "doctor": "OK, and the last time that it was done, was it normal?"}, {"patient": "eah, they said yeah. My heart rate's been around 80 beats per minute which is good and I haven't had any symptoms so things have been stable.", "doctor": "OK, good.

Or is that just for other cardiovascular issues or some sort of preventative measure?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I heard it was good for people who have atrial fibrillation so I started taking it.", "doctor": "OK. and let's revisit your medications at the end of today's session. I just want to make sure that you're on the medications and I just want to make sure you're on the right dose.  Does that sound good?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, certainly.", "doctor": "K great. And ok, so we talked about your past medical history and medications. We will talk a little bit about any allergies that you have, if you have any."}, {"patient": "I think it's like a sulfa allergy.

And how many milligrams?"}, {"patient": "I'm not sure, I know it's their lowest dose though.", "doctor": "OK, OK if it's lowest dose, it might be 2.5 milligrams."}, {"patient": "Sounds familiar.", "doctor": "OK good. Is there a particular reason you take these CBD edibles?"}, {"patient": "It helps me sleep.", "doctor": "OK, if it's specifically to help you sleep, we can actually try and see if there are other options for you. You know there are pills, like they are sleep aids. Or even things like melatonin that can help regulate your sleep so we can revisit other options for you if you're open to that as well."}, {"patient": "OK for sure. Yeah I will. Um, yeah we can talk about that later.", "doctor": "OK, that sounds good and do you do any other recreational drugs?"}, {"patient": "I do not.", "doctor": "OK, how about alcohol?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, I don't drink anymore.", "doctor": "OK, and did you used to drink before?"}, {"patient": "Yes, I just stopped a few years ago,", "doctor": "OK, and what's your living situation like right now?"}, {"patient": "I live in a house with my wife.", "doctor": "In a house, OK. Any concerns for like old carpets, mold or asbestos in your house?"}, {"patient": "No, we've renovated it over the years.", "doctor": "OK, good and I apologize, but I would like to clarify three more symptoms with you. Did you say you felt like you had a fever earlier?"}, {"patient": "Um, maybe I've been feeling a little hot, but it's been really more the cough and shortness of breath that's been bugging me.", "doctor": "OK, well we can take a temperature today just to make sure. Have you been feeling like you have night sweats or chills?"}, {"patient": "Um, not really. No, I haven't noticed that.", "doctor": "OK, and how about, um, any weight loss over the past few months?"}, {"patient": "No, it's been been stable.", "doctor": "OK, alright good, so that brings us to the end. Do you have any questions or concerns that you would like to clarify before we end the interview?"}, {"patient": "No, nothing today.  I was just really hoping to get, uh, whatever this is sorted out.", "doctor": "Yeah, you know, um, right now it looks like, it sounds like it could be an upper respiratory viral illness, so that includes COVID.  So we will do a swab for you and then send it off to the lab for PCR results. In the meantime, because you have symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, we do encourage isolation for 14 days. Until your symptoms are gone, sorry,  until your symptoms are gone, even if they're gone, we do suggest isolating for 14 days just to make sure you're not a carrier or could spread COVID so we do encourage that, and that includes from your husband. If possible, we will get those results in a day or two. If they are positive, we will send your results to public health who will be in touch with you to do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten it from. If it's not COVID, it could be other viral illnesses that are going around this time of year. And if your symptoms aren't getting better on their own, and there's reason to suspect you may have a bacterial infection or bacterial pneumonia, we will follow up with you and possibly prescribe antibiotics. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, that sounds like a great plan.", "doctor": "OK, great so um, I will see you at the next appointment."}]}
{"id": "RES0063", "conversation_pairs": [{"patient": "Yeah, so I've been feeling just really down recently in the last week. I started off by having this sore throat which started around 5 days ago and then I also noticed I've been getting some chills over the last few day. And on top of all of that, within the last three to four days I've been getting muscle aches all over my body.", "doctor": "OK, alright so the sore throat started 5 days ago and then the fever started when?"}, {"patient": "So the fever. I think I haven't measured it, but I started having chills like 3 days ago.", "doctor": "Three days ago, OK, and the muscle aches started two days ago?"}, {"patient": "I would say 3 days ago as well.", "doctor": "Three days ago, OK. OK, are you having any trouble swallowing foods or fluids?"}, {"patient": "A little bit with solids with a sore throat but liquids, I'm doing OK right now.", "doctor": "OK. And is it hard for you to like, are you having issues vocalising at all?"}, {"patient": "No, I think my voice has been the same. It's just when I'm not talking, especially if I'm swallowing my own like spit, it still hurts sometimes, but mainly with solid food.", "doctor": "OK, OK and then, are you having any issues with taste or smell?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, I don't think so.", "doctor": "OK, how about hearing or vision?"}, {"patient": "No, no changes.", "doctor": "Any weight loss over the past few weeks?"}, {"patient": "No, I probably have gained weight.", "doctor": "OK, any fatigue or exhaustion?"}, {"patient": "Now that you mention it, I do feel pretty tired over the last few days, I don't know if it's just because of my muscles aching all the time, or I don't know. I have definitely felt very tired.", "doctor": "OK, how about changes in your hair, nails or skin like rashes?"}, {"patient": "No, nothing like that.", "doctor": "Do you have a cough at all?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't really noticed the cough.", "doctor": "How about shortness of breath or wheezing?"}, {"patient": "No, no shortness of breath or wheezing.", "doctor": "OK chest pain or you feeling like your heart's racing?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No, and how about dizziness or fainting spells?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, I haven't had any of those.", "doctor": "OK, how about changes to your bowel movements?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't think so. I go regularly once a day and I haven't noticed any watery stool or diarrhea.", "doctor": "OK, that's good. Any changes in your appetite?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, with a sore throat I tend to like eat softer foods right now. I can't really, I don't really feel like eating.", "doctor": "Yeah, OK. How about nausea or vomiting?"}, {"patient": "No, no, nothing like that.", "doctor": "OK, OK, and any issues with joint pain? You said your muscle aches, but how about joints?"}, {"patient": "Um, no, I don't think it's specifically my joints. I think more so I would say like around in my thighs. Then I would say just my upper arms hurt a lot. And even, uh, my upper back area hurts a lot as well, so it's kind of just everywhere. But those are some areas that hurt the most.", "doctor": "OK, OK, are you otherwise healthy?"}, {"patient": "Um, yeah, I do have a couple of things on my list. I do have high blood pressure. I have diabetes and other than that, I also have like high cholesterol.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "Yeah, that's just some of the things that I've been diagnosed with.", "doctor": "Yeah, OK, and do you take medication for any of these things?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, so I take for the blood pressure, I take this medication called the Ramipril.", "doctor": "OK yeah."}, {"patient": "And then for diabetes I'm taking Metformin. And then for the cholesterol I'm taking this medication called Crestor, yeah. Yeah, but other than that, just like vitamin D and multi vitamins. Those are some of the medications that I'm taking.", "doctor": "Sure yeah, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"}, {"patient": "Yup.", "doctor": "OK, do you know if you got a vaccine called Shingrix for shingles and Pneumovax for pneumococcal infections?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I actually think I got them just this past season. Uh, with all this COVID going on, I just wanted to make sure I got all those vaccines as well. So yeah, I recently just got them.", "doctor": "OK, good. And and how about any allergies?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, I don't have any allergies.", "doctor": "OK, how about family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, no lung conditions and uhh heart conditions, both my mom and dad suffered from like high blood pressure. My dad also had a heart attack when in his 60s. Now there is some heart conditions that run in the family.", "doctor": "OK, OK. And then any cancers in the family?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, m son actually got diagnosed with colorectal cancer just a few years ago.", "doctor": "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."}, {"patient": "He's doing OK though. Like it was pretty scary at the time.", "doctor": "How old was he when he was diagnosed?"}, {"patient": "I think he was, yeah in his forties, 46.", "doctor": "OK, well he's yeah, that's young. Have you had a colonoscopy?"}, {"patient": "Yeah I had it done. Everything came back normal so yeah, I'm not sure where he got it from.", "doctor": "OK. Have you had any sick contacts recently?"}, {"patient": "No, no sick contacts that I know of. I've been mainly in my house. I do go outside for groceries and some things like that, but other than that I'm retired. I don't really go out too much.", "doctor": "Yeah, OK, and you said you're retired. Do you live alone? Do you live with anyone?"}, {"patient": "No, yeah, I live alone now. And I live in London in an apartment", "doctor": "OK, any old carpets? Mold, dust, asbestos?"}, {"patient": "No, nothing like that. It's a pretty safe building.", "doctor": "OK, good, and do you smoke?"}, {"patient": "I used to. I used to smoke, probably in my 20s to late 40s, but then I quit.", "doctor": "OK, good, good for you. How much did you smoke before you quit?"}, {"patient": "Probably one to two packs a day, I would say.", "doctor": "OK, that's good, that's good that you quit. Do you drink any alcohol?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, I just stick to some red wine, maybe a couple times a week.", "doctor": "OK, couple times a week so two to three times?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I would say two to three times and, uh, I probably go through maybe 1 bottle every two weeks.", "doctor": "OK, OK. And then any marijuana?"}, {"patient": "No, no, I've never had any marijuana or any recreational drugs, no, nothing else.", "doctor": "OK, good, well those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, uh, with all this COVID and the pandemic going on, I don't know, I like, I've been mainly at my house, but like I said I do go to do my own groceries. Of course I wear a mask, but I don't know if I might have caught COVID,  so that's something I was worried about.", "doctor": "Yeah, for sure. I think just because your symptoms do overlap with those of COVID, we will be doing a COVID swab today and you should hear back about your results in 24 to 48 hours. But you should still self-isolate for 14 days because you do have similar symptoms and if it's not COVID, it's probably another viral illness that's going around these days and for that you don't need any medication, like prescribed medications, but just keep an eye on that, on your symptoms. Stay hydrated, eat well. If you need to lower your feve, you can use Tylenol. And if your symptoms worsen or you start getting neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Sounds good. I just had another quick question. I did get the shingles and the pneumococcal vaccine back then but I didn't get the flu vaccine, like should I get it? Is it recommended?", "doctor": "Yes, it's definitely recommended. So we won't give you the vaccine right now because you have symptoms. But once you are healthy again, you should definitely get the get the flu vaccine and you should get it once a year."}, {"patient": "OK, I just never took those vaccines, but I'll do that from now on.", "doctor": "Yeah, it's a good idea, and even if you get the flu, your symptoms won't be as severe if you have the vaccine, so it's definitely something to consider."}, {"patient": "OK, alright sounds good.", "doctor": "Alright, take care."}]}
{"id": "RES0064", "conversation_pairs": [{"patient": "My child has been having a sore throat and chills yesterday as well.", "doctor": "OK, so you mentioned the sore throat started three to four days ago and the chills started yesterday. And is he having any issues swallowing food or fluids?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, it seems like appetite's gone down, like a lot of pain in his throat, especially when swallowing solid foods.", "doctor": "Have you taken a look into his throat? Is it red? Do you see any yellow streaking white stuff, anything like that?"}, {"patient": "I definitely did take a look yesterday and definitely saw a lot of redness. I don't know if I saw any white or yellow streaks, but definitely looks very red in there.", "doctor": "OK, do his tonsils look enlarged?"}, {"patient": "Uh, everything looks swollen in there, I don't know what's what, but it does look very angry in there.", "doctor": "OK, OK. And has he had a stuffy nose or runny nose?"}, {"patient": "No, not really, no.", "doctor": "Any loss of taste or smell?"}, {"patient": "No, nothing like that.", "doctor": "OK, how about changes in vision or hearing?

There's a few that I felt over the last few days.", "doctor": "OK, coughing?"}, {"patient": "No, hasn't been coughing at all", "doctor": "OK, um, and how about shortness of breath or wheezing?"}, {"patient": "No, nothing like that.", "doctor": "Chest pain?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Feeling like his heart is racing?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Swelling in his limbs?"}, {"patient": "No. I haven't noticed anything like that.", "doctor": "OK, dizziness or fainting spells?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Headaches?"}, {"patient": "He was complaining of a headache a few days ago, but it kind of went away on its own.", "doctor": "OK. So the headache's gone completely now."}, {"patient": "Yeah, yeah.", "doctor": "OK. Have any confusion or memory loss?"}, {"patient": "No, not that I know.", "doctor": "Joint pain or muscle aches?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, how about his bowel movements? Have those been normal?"}, {"patient": "No, no, he hasn't told me anything about that.", "doctor": "Any appetite changes?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, just with the trouble swallowing I'm trying to make sure that he gets like liquids because over the last few days he can't tolerate like solid foods at all.", "doctor": "Yeah, how about a weight loss over the past few weeks?"}, {"patient": "No, not really. t's just been over the last few days that he hasn't been eating like himself.", "doctor": "OK. Alright and has he been healthy otherwise?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, otherwise he's a very healthy child. We have rarely gone to a doctor for him before, so yeah, nothing. Nothing else with him.", "doctor": "OK, have you tried anything for his sore throat? Anything over the counter?"}, {"patient": "We did try, uh, like Tylenol cold. It helped with this headache, but it didn't really help with his sore throat", "doctor": "OK, and has he ever experienced anything like this in the past?"}, {"patient": "No, not that I know of.", "doctor": "OK. Any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Any medications that he's on?"}, {"patient": "No, no medication.", "doctor": "OK, is he up to date with all his immunizations?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, all his immunizations are up to date.", "doctor": "OK, any allergies?"}, {"patient": "No, not that I know.", "doctor": "OK, family history of lung conditions or heart conditions?"}, {"patient": "No, no lung or heart conditions. His father does have diabetes though.", "doctor": "OK, how old was he when he was diagnosed with diabetes?"}, {"patient": "I think probably in his late 30s with type 2 diabetes.", "doctor": "Type 2, OK and then any sick contacts recently that he may have had?"}, {"patient": "I don't think at home at least, uh, but maybe at school, like you never know who they are in contact with, so I'm wondering if he just picked it up somewhere from school.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "Yeah, yeah, they're all wearing masks right now, but I don't know if he picked something something up from his classmates.", "doctor": "Yeah for sure. OK, and then any travel to anywhere recently?"}, {"patient": "No, we've been at home, haven't left even to go to like a different city, have been in London the whole time.", "doctor": "OK, yeah, and who does he live with at home?"}, {"patient": "So he lives with myself and his dad.", "doctor": "Any siblings?"}, {"patient": "No, he's an only child.", "doctor": "OK, any reason to believe you have old carpets, mold, asbestos, anything that could be triggering his symptoms?"}, {"patient": "You know we don't have any pets. We don't have any like old carpets, it's a fairly new apartment, so I don't think any of that should be an issue.", "doctor": "Okay, well, I think those are all the questions that I had for him. Anything that you wanted to add or anything that I missed today?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, I think those are everything I wanted to talk about but I just was wondering if he needs to get tested or like if there's anything we can do today for him.", "doctor": "Yeah, so he does seem to be checking off some of the criteria for strep throat. So just to make sure, because he does have a score of right now at least three or four, or maybe even five, definitely over four, we can prescribe him some antibiotics. But we will do a rapid strep test first in the clinic here today just to rule out in or rule that out. If it comes back positive and I guess even if it isn't positive because he checked off a lot of the boxes for strep throat, we will give him a prescription for penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days. And then you can take that if his symptoms don't go away in a day or two. Because his symptoms also overlap with COVID, we will. do a swab for that as well and you should hear back within 24 to 48 hours and then you should isolate for 14 days. Does that sound good?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, that sounds good.", "doctor": "OK, great thank you."}]}

Or does it come and go?"}, {"patient": "I would say it's pretty constant now.", "doctor": "OK.

And how about your appetite?"}, {"patient": "I would say that's been OK as well, it's just hard to eat a lot of food because of this sore throat.", "doctor": "And is it just with solids or do you get the soreness with liquids too?"}, {"patient": "I would say mostly with solids, sometimes with liquid. If it's like really cold or something.", "doctor": "OK.

And are you taking any medications for your Crohn's disease?"}, {"patient": "I am on something for it, I think it's Sulfasalazine or something like that.", "doctor": "OK. And any other medications besides that?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, no, I don't think so.", "doctor": "Any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?"}, {"patient": "Um, I had a colonoscopy done. I just needed hospitalization for just the day I guess.", "doctor": "OK, and when was that?"}, {"patient": "That was also last year.", "doctor": "Last year, OK. And do you have any family history of any conditions that run in the family? Like do you have any Crohn's disease or Ulcerative Colitis that run in the family?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, both do.", "doctor": "Both do, OK. Any anything else that runs in the family?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, I know there's some asthma and eczema that run in the family too.", "doctor": "OK.

Alright, so do you partake in any like sports or activities or anything like that?"}, {"patient": "Um, I swim.", "doctor": "OK, any contact sports?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK. Alright, so yeah, overall it seems that you had this sore throat which is constant, getting worse and a bit of a fever in th last one or two days and you've also had swelling in your neck and so yeah, do you have any other questions or concerns?"}, {"patient": "No, like what do you think I have? Do you think it's COVID?", "doctor": "Yeah, so definitely at this time, you know whenever people have any respiratory symptoms we always want to rule out COVID.  So will definitely get a swab for COVID testing done for you today which should come back within 24 to 48 hours and in the meantime you should self isolate. And other than that, it can also be, due to this swelling in your lymph nodes and also just the other symptoms, it can be other viral infections. It can be mono so we definitely have to do a couple of tests, and there's one test that will do for mono as well which is called EBV antibody testing. So we'll do a couple of these tests today and then see what what comes back. And in the meantime you should definitely self isolate if you haven't been doing so already."}, {"patient": "OK, sure I can do that.", "doctor": "Yeah, do you have any questions?"}, {"patient": "No, that sounds good.

Yeah, so is there anything else? Any other questions that you have for me today?"}, {"patient": "No, what do you think I have?", "doctor": "Yeah, so there's definitely multiple things that can be going on. Since you were just recently admitted, maybe you might have another bacterial r espiratory infection, like a pneumonia or it could be viral as well. So the first thing we want to do is for sure get COVID swab done and then we will also get, since you were admitted, as well recently, we want to get an X Ray on you just to see if there's any pneumonia. OK, and so we'll be keeping you here for a bit until everything comes back. We'll get some blood work done for you as well to see if there's any infection in your body. And then yeah, so just sit tight, we'll get all those things done. Is that OK with you?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, that's great. Thank you.", "doctor": "You're welcome, yeah. So well will be updating you shortly."}]}

So I'll give you that kind of timeline. So two days ago she was feeling hot and her fever hasn't broken. We've been giving her Tylenol, but she still seems to have a fever. The last time I checked her temperature was 38.5 and she seems to have issues swallowing food. She's drooling and she seems short of breath.", "doctor": "OK, and when did she start getting short of breath?"}, {"patient": "That started yesterday.", "doctor": "Has her fever been getting worse or has it stayed around the same?"}, {"patient": "So I just checked the first day. It was like 38, 38.5.", "doctor": "OK, and when did the trouble swallowing start?"}, {"patient": "That started yesterday as well.", "doctor": "OK, and has it been getting worse at all?"}, {"patient": "I think so. Now she's barely even drinking fluids.", "doctor": "OK, so it's both solids and fluids. OK, have you noticed any swelling in her neck area or redness or swelling in her throat?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I've noticed some of that.", "doctor": "OK, you see a lot of redness in there?"}, {"patient": "I see, yeah, I see quite a bit of redness in there.", "doctor": "And has she been drooling at all?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, a little bit today.", "doctor": "OK. Alright, any coughing?"}, {"patient": "Not hat I noticed.", "doctor": "No coughing. OK, and do you notice that she's increasingly fatigued, or just not herself? Or is she irritable?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, she's very irritable.", "doctor": "OK, do you notice any kind of paleness or blueness in her skin? Anything like that?"}, {"patient": "She's not blue. She's looking a little pale though.", "doctor": "OK, and sorry, when did the shortness of breath start? Is it getting worse at all?"}, {"patient": "Shortness of breath started yesterday as well, moreso today which is why I brought her in.", "doctor": "OK, any other symptoms like nausea or vomiting or diarrhea or constipation?"}, {"patient": "Um, no nothing like that.", "doctor": "OK, and how's her appetite and sleep?"}, {"patient": "It's been, it's been not great. She's not eating well, I guess because she's in a lo of pain and she didn't sleep well for the past two nights either.", "doctor": "OK uhm, has she had any recent infections at all, like a cold or anything like that?"}, {"patient": "She did have a cough 2 weeks ago, yeah.", "doctor": "OK, and did it just go away on it's own or did she need any antibiotics or any other medications?"}, {"patient": "I think no, she didn't need any antibiotics. It kind of went away on its own.", "doctor": "OK, any sick contacts within the last week or two weeks?"}, {"patient": "I mean, she goes to daycare so she might have picked something up from there. Yeah, last I checked, no one at daycare was sick like right now.

I'll give them a call to le them know that you're coming. Yeah, and what they will most likely do there is get a test done to see if she has H. flu and also they might do perhaps like a COVID swab as well. They might get an X Ray of her neck as well to see it. So what I think might be going on is with H. flu you can get swelling of your epiglottis and it can kind of obstruct your throat. It's very urgent matter, so that's why we will make sure you get to the ER and, uh, you know, we'll go from there. Does that sound? I know it may be very worrying right now. Do you have any questions at all?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, do you know how long will she have to be in the hospital?", "doctor": "So right now we just need to make sure that she's stable, like all her vitals. You know when she gets to the ER, they can give her the appropriate antibiotics as well. And based on that, we need to make sure her breathing get stabilized, so she might be in the ER for one day. If they think she needs to be on IV antibiotics in the hospital, she might be in the hospital for a few more days or even a week. So it's really hard to say right now, but our priority right now is to make sure she's stabilized in the ER."}, {"patient": "OK. OK yeah, that sounds good.", "doctor": "So I'll give them a call right now, and, uh, you can head over to the ER. Or if you need a ride, we can arrange to do that for you too."}, {"patient": "OK, great, that sounds great.", "doctor": "Thank you."}]}

Do you have any questions at all for me?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, what was like, what do you think I have?", "doctor": "Yeah, so from the symptoms that you're describing, it does seem more like sinus issues. There's a sinus behind your face and what can happen is if you get an infection, like all the the mucous and everything can build up and increase the pressure. That's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face.  It's because of a sinus infection most likely. And usually like, it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses, and then some oral decongestents. Or have you tried any anti histamines?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't.", "doctor": "OK, so no antihistamines. It seems most likely that you have a sinus infection. It can be bacterial with the yellow discharge that you're having as well. So we can give you some antibiotics, so will give you some. Amoxicillin."}, {"patient": "Sure.", "doctor": "So it's only been three day since you're having these symptoms, right?  And you haven't had any high fever or anything like that?

And will set up another appointment for when we can do like a phone appointment and or clinic appointment when your doses are done. Does that sound good?"}, {"patient": "Yeah that sounds great.

But if your symptoms worsen, like you start getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should come back to the ER and we'll get that checked out.

So do you, I was just wondering if you know what it could be.", "doctor": "Yeah, so the grunting is worrisome. He could have anything from bronchiolitis to pneumonia so what we'll do is, we'll, first get his temperature, we'll get his O2 sat and we will get some imaging done as well to see if it's more in line with bronchiolitis or pneumonia. If it's bronchiolitis, it will be supportive treatment so we can keep him here at the hospital because he is in some distress and we'll keep him hydrated and give him some oxygen. And if it's pneumonia, we'll prescribe him some antibiotics.

Do you drink alcohol?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't drink alcohol, no drugs, yeah, I'm pretty, I like to stay very fit and healthy so nothing like that.", "doctor": "OK, and have you been in contact with any sick people recently?"}, {"patient": "No, not that I know of. I live by myself in my apartment. I've been working from home. I work as a programmer and so I only go outside for runs and stuff for groceries, so I haven't really seen anyone sick around me.", "doctor": "Yeah, and have you traveled anywhere recently?"}, {"patient": "No, I've mainly been at home.", "doctor": "OK, good, and where's home?"}, {"patient": "Home is in Hamilton Ontario and I've just been working from home.", "doctor": "OK, do you live in a house, apartment, who do you live with?"}, {"patient": "I just live in an apartment by myself.

So those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I was just wondering if I should go back on the puffers. I don't have any right now, I just don't know if my asthma has just uh, come back.", "doctor": "Yeah so, what we're gonna do is, we're going to do a PFT, so pulmonary function test on you, cause it's been a while since you've had one of those done. And that's just to check how well your lung is functioning, so we'll do that. We'll also maybe get a chest X-ray as well for baseline and depending on what those two come back as, we'll probably get you to use your short acting beta agonist puffer again and we'll also give you a long acting."}, {"patient": "OK.", "doctor": "As well as an inhaled cortico steroid. So, actually, you know what, we'll give you an inhaled cortico steroid and a short acting beta agonist because you can't use both the steroid and the long, so we'll start with those two. We'll start with the short acting as well as inhaled cortico steroid. And if we find that your asthma is just based on like, exertion or like something called athletic asthma, we can also try something called Cromolyn instead but we'll discuss that more. Right now our priority is to get your symptoms under control, so we'll start with the short acting as well as the inhaled cortico steroid. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you so much.", "doctor": "Yeah, no problem."}]}

I don't know if he needs them right now or what would you recommend?", "doctor": "Yeah, uhm so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before I can come up with like a management plan for him. So once I do, if I see, uhm, if his tympanic membrane has been perforated or I see pus in there, we'll prescribe him like 10 days of antibiotics. We can give him either Amoxicillin, or if he has bad reactions to penicillins,  we can give him Cefuroxime and then if, uh, it doesn't seem to have any systemic symptoms, so if he has systemic symptoms like fever, which we'll check for today, and if he's like been really ill and he has like a middle ear effusion or bulging tympanic membrane, again we'll give him antibiotics for 10 days. But if his tympanic membrane is just bulging a little bit, or if he has some middle ear effusion but no systemic symptoms, like, no fevers, and he seems to be fine otherwise, we'll reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see if he's better and if he's not, again, will prescribe him antibiotics.

Do you have any questions or concerns?"}, {"patient": "No, no questions, but uhm, actually, what do you think she has and how can we treat her?", "doctor": "Yeah, so it seems like that the hoarseness of voice and the sore throat and her symptoms mostly align with what's called laryngitis, and this is usually caused by like just a viral respiratory infection. The hoarseness of voice will usually last more than a week and up to like ten days and it should resolve on its own. But we'll definitely take a better look and do a proper physical examination, see if I see any kind of swelling, redness, or any like white streaks or exudates around her pharynx as well. So after we take a look, we'll see what we can do. It doesn't seem like, it can also be a bacterial infection, in which case we would need to give her antibiotics, but usually it's a viral infection that should go away on its own. So we would just kind of wait and see and potentially just give her voice some rest during this period, and just go on from there. Do you have any other questions or concerns?"}, {"patient": "Uh no, that sounds great, thank you.", "doctor": "You're welcome and yeah, we'll, just do a full examination and then go from there."}, {"patient": "OK, sounds great thanks.", "doctor": "You're welcome.

So yeah."}, {"patient": "Oh I see, I see, OK.", "doctor": "Yeah, and other than that, do you have any questions or concerns at all?"}, {"patient": "No, what do you think I should do from, For now?", "doctor": "Yeah, so right now what we're going to do is because you're having the coughing, shortness of breath, and you have a history of COPD & CHF, we definitely want to make sure that you're not having, uhm, what I think you might be having isn't just an exacerbation of your COPD, and especially with the green sputum it might be like a bacterial infection that's causing your symptoms to get worse, so we'll do all the appropriate testing, we'll do, a chest X-ray, we'll get some blood work done as well, w'ell give you some uh, Ventolin as well while you're here, and we might give you like a steroid medication as well. So we'll do some of those things right now for you to kind of help you right now, as well as do some of those tests that I mentioned. Depending on what comes back, you might require an admission to the hospital just because we want to make sure you don't go home with an exacerbation, especially with the CHF as well, we need to, we will need to get that under control because that can get worse with your COPD exacerbation as well. So we need to make sure some of that, swelling goes down, if we need to adjust your medications while you're here.

You don't have any history of, uh, family history of lung cancer or anything like that, so right now, especially since you just moved from India where tuberclosis is endemic, we need to make sure that we test you for tuberculosis. In the meantime though, you will need to stay in the hospital and be in an isolated room, uh, where we can filter some of the air and make sure, it's a very infective condition if you do have it so while you're getting all the tests done, you will need to stay here in an isolated room. Also, we will get some sputum smears and cultures to test for TB and we will also, I will need to, if the test comes back positive we will need to contact public health and let your contacts know as well. Lastly, we will also be getting, since you're having the hemoptysis, like coughing up blood, we will, we might also do a chest X-ray to see if"}, {"patient": "OK", "doctor": "So those are, those are some of the things that we'll get started with.

Any questions or concerns?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, no nothing like that, uhm do I need to isolate?", "doctor": "Yeah, so we will keep you in an isolated room right now, when you're getting all those tests. And if you do have TB, you will need to isolate, uhm, and stay away from contacts, not be at work, we will, if you do in fact have TB, which it seems likely right now, you will be started in hospital on a ,like antibiotic therapy, uh, which consists of like four different medications and people with the active TB will do have to isolate during that time period, so yeah, we'll get some of those tests done and, we'll get back to you as soon as possible."}, {"patient": "OK, great, thank you.", "doctor": "You're welcome."}]}

Do you have any questions?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, what can I do about this runny nose?", "doctor": "Yeah, so it seems like it's been going on for more than one and a half week. What, what is reassuring is that you're not having any other symptoms that are concerning, like you're not having any cough, you're not having any green or yellow sputum, you're not having any fevers, so it seems that you might just be having a cold, which can be caused by just a viral, uh, infection, but it should go away on its own. Just make sure that you're getting some rest, you're hydrating well, uhm, you can get some over the counter medications like Tylenol cold for example, but for now I would say we should just wait and watch. But just in case, also, since it is one of the symptoms that's for covid as well, in this time period we will just get a covid swab just in case, but most likely it's nothing to be worried about. Until you get your test, I would recommend staying isolated. And then we can go on from there, is that, does that sound good to you?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, that sounds great.

It sounds like you had a, you had a cold last week and you just have this residual cough that's still there, and it's been two weeks and you're just worried about it, but otherwise you're feeling well, you don't have any other symptoms. Often times when we get sick, or we have an infection or inflammation of the, uhm, the airway, we can get a cough that lasts a long time and it might just take you a couple more weeks for the cough to go away. But if you feel that it's getting any worse or you're, you have those symptoms come back again, or you develop a fever, we can, you can definitely, we can do something more about that.

I haven't seen my family doctor in a number of years now though.", "doctor": "Yeah, well, you know it's, it's a good idea to see your family doctor on a regular basis, specially when you're getting older, because sometimes you might need changes in your medications, or there might be checkups or screenings that they might want to do.

It's possible that while you were drunk that you might have, and given that you have acid reflux, that you might have accidentally have something go inside your breathing tube from, from your mouth or something that came up from your stomach and sometimes when that happens, food items can or other things can get lodged in your lungs and can become, uhm, can attract bacteria to, uh, to replicate and cause a bacterial infection, so it's possible that, that's what happened But it could also be a viral pneumonia or a viral infection in your chest. we'll get a chest x-ray done, we'll have some labs done as well, and we'll likely start some antibiotics. Have you recently been on any antibiotics?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't.", "doctor": "And you don't have any allergies to any, correct?"}, {"patient": "Correct.", "doctor": "Alright, OK, we'll also do a physical exam just to give a listen to your, to your lungs and see how they're doing and then go from there.

And were there any other symptoms that, or anything else that you wanted to tell me that maybe I forgot to ask about?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, no, I was just, uh, I'm just worried about him, uhm about his fever specifically, it's been high and I know that usually when he has these hospitalizations, he presents pretty similarly. So just wondering if he would need to be hospitalized again and if he needs antibiotics.", "doctor": "Yeah, for sure it's, it's been uhm, so it's been three or four days, but with a fever this high and his symptoms, with uh, having obstruction, discharge, uhm, changes to smell or loss of smell it does sound like it could be bacterial and so I think it would be reasonable to possibly to start antibiotics in this case, but we'll go through, through a physical exam, check some vitals and go from there."}]}

I'm also getting some wheezing and tightness in my chest as well as some cough. So yeah, that's all just been happening over the last day.", "doctor": "OK, and uh, is the shortness of breath here now? is it, is at rest? Or are you having that when you're exerting yourself?"}, {"patient": "No, it's more so just the tightness. I wouldn't call it pain, but I do still have a little bit of wheezing.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "So yeah, that's, that's that.", "doctor": "And you mentioned a cough as well.

I haven't had shortness of breath for a pretty long time.", "doctor": "OK, uh, and, uh, we'll get back to the past medical history shortly, I just wanted to ask a few more symptoms, but certainly could be relevant today.

Uhm, and I haven't been taking the one, uh, I think it's called Ventolin. But I took it like, uh, had to take it like three or four times last night and like, throughout the day yesterday. And it, it did help, but it didn't really relieve some of my symptoms.", "doctor": "OK, and prior to that, how often have you been using, uhm, the blue one."}, {"patient": "The blue one before yesterday, probably the last time I used it was probably like a month ago.", "doctor": "OK, so you don't need it that that often then?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Do you have any triggers for asthma that you're aware of, like exercising or going out into the cold or even like allergies like dust or, or, or pollen?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, I do have allergies in the spring. I think it's to pollen and in the winter, it does, like my symptoms do get a bit worse and I have to use the ventil more. But recently for the last few months at least, it's been pretty stable. I haven't really had to use, use it too much.", "doctor": "OK, and, and do you use any other medications?"}, {"patient": "Uh, just when I have allergies. I, I just use over the counter allergy meds.", "doctor": "OK, and you use a cream for, for your skin too like, yeah?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I use, like it's, it's, I think it's like a mixture of like a steroid cream.", "doctor": "OK, and do you have any allergies to medications?"}, {"patient": "Not that I know of.", "doctor": "OK, and are your immunizations up to date?"}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "Alright, and right now, who are you living with, and whereabouts are you living?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, so I'm just living with a couple roommates.

But besides that, that was, that was uh, that was it?", "doctor": "OK, and  sorry, just had to backtrack a little bit. Have you had any hospitalizations, either due to asthma or for any other reason?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, I think when I was 15, I, I had to go to the emergency department, but I, I wasn't hospitalized.", "doctor": "OK, and was this, uh, did you have similar symptoms at that time?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, it was, uh, it was for asthma and like, uh, that time it was definitely much much worse and I remember like I was breathing a lot, uh, the shortness of breath was really bad and the ventolin like puffers weren't even helping me at that time.", "doctor": "OK yeah, OK, and have you had any surgeries before?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Alright, so yeah, you mentioned that you're, you're cleaning up the basement yesterday? Was there a lot of dust down there or anything like that, that might have triggered it?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, we were like just moving boxes. There were books here and there that definitely there would have been dust. I should have been more careful, like wore a mask, but I didn't think about it at that time.", "doctor": "OK yeah for sure, uh, and do you smoke cigarettes?"}, {"patient": "No, like I can't even stand cigarette smoke.", "doctor": "OK, that's good.

She also has the eczema that I have and my mom was also diagnosed with asthma when she was a child, but she's been completely fine since then.", "doctor": "OK, well that's good that, that she's been OK. Does anybody in the family have any heart or, or lung conditions or any cancers that run in the family?"}, {"patient": "My grandfather died of lung cancer, but he was just, just smoked all throughout his life.", "doctor": "OK, uhm, alright, so that was all of the questions that I wanted to ask today. So the next part we'll go on to do a physical exam, but did you have any thing else that maybe I forgot to ask about today?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, I, I, I think I know what this was caused by, but yeah, let's, let's see. Thanks for your help.", "doctor": "Oh you're welcome, so yeah, we'll, we'll, uhm,trial some more puffers and see what we could do, cause certainly it's sounding like an asthma exacerbation, and so definitely let somebody know if your, your breathing is getting more difficult."}]}

And that reminds me, actually, how has your weight been over the last several months? Have you had any weight changes?"}, {"patient": "Not really, like I, I, I think over the last two years I've just been very focused on my fitness, so I feel like I've probably lost around 30 pounds over the last year.

Maybe a beer on the weekend, but that's it.", "doctor": "Alright. So I think that was all I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that, that you wanted to add before we go on to the exam and?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, so I, I, I don't know if I should get a test done, like for covid. Uhm yeah, that's all, just wondering if I, if I can do that here?", "doctor": "Yeah, so that is something that that is on the differential for what could be causing your symptoms, especially with uhm, starting at having a cough and the nonspecific viral type symptoms with the cough, headache, muscle aches, so certainly could be caused by covid, but there are other reasons for, that could explain these symptoms, such as other types of viral illnesses, and so we will do a PCR swab today, as well as do, well, check your vitals to see if you have a fever now and we'll also maybe send an influenza swab as well, and and do some blood work. But in the meantime, since we're running the covid swab, it will be important to self isolate for the next 14 days and we will let you know what the test results show. But despite, even if they are negative, it will be important to still stay self isolating for the next 14 days."}, {"patient": "OK, I'll do that.

My fiance does go to his work like a couple, like three or four times during the week, so I don't know if he got into contact with anyone, It's, it's hard to say.", "doctor": "Has he been sick at all? Like any, any cough, sore throat, anything, like that?"}, {"patient": "He did have a sore throat last week, but it kind of just went away on its own in a couple of days and compared to me, like, his was nothing really.", "doctor": "OK, uh.

So that was everything that I wanted to ask about on history, and so next we'll go ahead and get vitals and do a physical exam. But did you have anything else that maybe I forgot to ask about, or any other symptoms maybe?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't think so. Do you think it can be covid at all?", "doctor": "Uhm, so covid does present in a variety of non specific ways and so it certainly could be on the differential for causing a sore throat and abdominal pain and as well as a fever. However, it could be caused by other things as well. Uhm, currently your constellation of symptoms, with the enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, sore throat, it sounds like you may have uhm, an inflamed spleen as well, which could all be signs and symptoms of something called EBV or, or mono. And it sounds like you might have had an exposure, like your husband or fiance rather may have had this last week with the sore throat. All that being said, today we'll do the monospot test to check for that as well as some blood work. And we will do a covid swab as well, just in case."}, {"patient": "OK, that sounds good.

No lung cancer history right, in your family?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "OK, uhm so we definitely want to do testing for TB. Will do us a smear today of your sputum and we will, since you have been in contact with your family, we will have to contact a public health if the tests come back positive, and it seems that, we'll also do some other testing. Sometimes with tuberculosis you can get something called pericarditis, and some of the symptoms you are having may point to pericarditis as well, so we might have to do an EKG. We might have to further do an ultrasound, an x-ray, for example. So first we'll just get the TB test done and then if it comes back positive, you will need to isolate, be admitted to the hospital as well, and be on a course of antibiotics. So I know this is a lot to take in. Do you have any questions or concerns at all?"}, {"patient": "Not right now.

And if it's positive, public health will be in touch umm, to do some contact tracing. In the meantime, because you have a cough, it is recommended that you isolate for 14 days. And if it's not Covid, but it's probably something like acute bronchitis or some other viral infection that's going around at this time of year, so for that we can, you can just treat it with like supportive treatments. You know, like staying hydrated, uhm, good nutrition, good sleep and just keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse or really severe like you're having neurological symptoms and just seek help from the ER."}, {"patient": "For sure. Thank you.", "doctor": "Yeah, take care."}]}

He had it.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "Yeah, comes and goes.", "doctor": "His eczema comes and goes?"}, {"patient": "Hmm.", "doctor": "OK, um is he on any medications?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No? Even for his eczema?"}, {"patient": "It's pretty mild.", "doctor": "OK. Um has, have you ever like given him um Reactine or like any of the, those anti allergy medications in the past?"}, {"patient": "I've tried the, uh, yeah, the ones over the counter, um, they do help. Um, I tried it this time, but uh it didn't do much.", "doctor": "OK. OK. And, I was gonna ask you something else. Um, his symptoms, like the sneezing and the, and the runny nose, like has he experienced this before?"}, {"patient": "Oh yeah.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "It usually gets worse um uh I guess like around this time, uh I can tell when spring is coming up. Um, it gets pretty bad, but he always has a runny nose um and he sneezes sometimes here and there.", "doctor": "OK, and you mentioned this has been going on for more than four days this time around?"}, {"patient": "It's been, it's been going on for the past uh two weeks.", "doctor": "OK. OK, and is it like um impairing his like daily activities or like his ability to um like, sleep?"}, {"patient": "Uh it does affect his sleep sometimes he doesn't like um, just the itching really bothers him.", "doctor": "Mhmm."}, {"patient": "So he can't uh, he finds it hard to fall asleep. That's like, I usually, that's when I give him the the medications. To help him fall asleep.", "doctor": "OK. OK. And uh is he up to date with all his immunizations?"}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "OK. Any family history of asthma, eczema, or something called allergic rhinitis?"}, {"patient": "Uh I have asthma.", "doctor": "OK. And is your asthma severe?"}, {"patient": "Uh no, it's it's pretty well controlled. I used to, actually, I used to have asthma as a child.", "doctor": "OK, I see."}, {"patient": "It's pretty well controlled right now. I don't even need medications.", "doctor": "OK, OK."}, {"patient": "I remember I used to, I used to get allergies as well as a child.", "doctor": "Oh I see."}, {"patient": "But very similar, lots of sneezing and yeah.", "doctor": "Mhmm, alright. Were you ever, did you ever take like an allergy test?"}, {"patient": "No. I didn't think about it, I just never, like my my my parents didn't take me to get that testing done.", "doctor": "OK, how about your son? Has he been allergy tested?"}, {"patient": "No, but I feel like he probably should.", "doctor": "Yeah, OK. And then, does anyone at home smoke?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No, OK. Um do you have any, like old carpets, dust, mold, or asbestos at your place?"}, {"patient": "Uh we've got all of, we got our carpets uh removed uh two years ago. That's actually helped uh with his symptoms. Uh and I know, we tried it, we removed the curtains as well and we've used blinds. So yeah.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "And I don't think so, I don't think there's any spores or things like that.", "doctor": "OK, good. Um, is he an otherwise healthy child like developmental wise, like he's growing, gaining weight OK, like he's, his motor skills and like social behaviours are all up to par with his peers?"}, {"patient": "Oh yeah he's doing great.", "doctor": "OK OK good um those are all the questions I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No, OK. So for him um it sounds more in keeping with something called allergic rhinitis than an infection, but because his symptoms do overlap with that of Covid,  we'll probably get him a swab anyways, and those results should come back in 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, rhinitis is, allergic rhinitis is caused by allergies to certain things, so we can get him allergy tested um and that will give us a better understanding of like what his triggers are and the way to treat that is to avoid those triggers, those allergens. And if his symptoms are persistent, um we will prescribe him also like an intranasal corticosteroid. Um and there are like, there are like second line treatments as well, like antihistamines and leukotriene, like leukotriene receptor antagonists, but those are like second line. We'll we'll see how he does with the inhaled corticosteroids at first. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Sounds great.", "doctor": "OK, great."}, {"patient": "Thank you.", "doctor": "No problem."}]}

So you started that two weeks ago, OK. Are you up to date with all your immunizations?"}, {"patient": "Uh yeah, I think so.", "doctor": "OK, any allergies?"}, {"patient": "Uhm penicillin, I just get uh I get a rash.

But because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we still recommend isolating for 14 days. But the other thing I want to mention is that you don't have any other symptoms of infection besides your cough, and it seems like the cough started a week ago and you started this new medication ramipril two weeks ago, and so ramipril is a type of ACE inhibitor and one of its side effects is that in some people it can cause coughing. So, I am going to review your medications and if your family Doc also agrees, we may try uh another um blood pressure medication for you instead of ramipril."}, {"patient": "Sure.", "doctor": "Um so we'll try and change that medication and see if your coughing stops.

It's a little bit less effective as you um go past a certain age, you are still obviously nowhere close to that, but it's,  I I don't believe it's covered after the age of 26 either, so it's best if you get it done earlier.

Um given uh the symptoms that you have, it sounds like you have um an an inflammation or swelling of your throat which could be caused by bacteria or viruses. It could be something like um mono, or it could be um strep throat. Um it could be other things as well. Um seeing that your symptoms are somewhat overlapping with the symptoms for covid, we would also like to do a Covid test. Um we'll do a rapid strep test here as well um just to rule it out and then uh we'll uh ask you to quarantine for the next 14 days um until or at least until your covid swabs are back or your symptoms improve um and we'll let you know about um the management based on the strep test result.

Um if he hasn't been eating, drinking well, hasn't slept well, has been fussy, and and has been lethargic and tired, uh and is having difficulty swallowing food, um that's definitely very um serious. Uh we'll have a look inside his mouth and see what's going on. It could be that he has an infection or an inflammation of some sort. Um given his fever, he probably has an infection, um and uh we'll likely start him on antibiotics and put in an IV drip just to get in get some fluids inside him, just to get him hydrated, uh and monitor him very closely.

And are your puff puffers giving you any relief at all from the coughing fits?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I've been using the Ventolin uh more and it it does seem to help.", "doctor": "OK, OK. Uh do you find they're not working as much as they used to though?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I feel like uh before, I didn't really like, it, just last year I didn't really have to take it too much. Um like even when I use the puffer, I start getting coughing like maybe half an hour later and so it's not, I don't think it's as effective.", "doctor": "OK, yeah. Um OK.

I work from home too, so haven't really been seeing anyone.", "doctor": "OK, that's good. And um travel to anywhere recently? Outside the province?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, outside of the province, no, not not for like the last year at least.", "doctor": "OK, OK. Um so those were kind of all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for me?"}, {"patient": "Um yeah, I was just wondering like what you think it might be.", "doctor": "Yeah, so it definitely sounds like a COPD exacerbation, but because your symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will take a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and you can you can self isolate for 14 days um and if it's positive, public health will be in touch with you to um do some contact tracing, but in the meantime we'll also do a work up for the COPD exacerbation. Um it seems like you have taken the correct steps so far in like stopping like stopping your smoking and um taking your puffers as needed. Um so right now we will continue using the puffers that you have, and if you don't already have a long acting beta agonist, we'll give you that as well as, if it's like if it gets really severe, we'll also give you some inhaled corticosteroids um and we'll also check your oxygen saturation to make sure it's over uh 88% um and we'll give you oxygen if you need it. Um as well, some antibiotics to consider, you mentioned that you were allergic to amoxicillin, so we might give you like a macrolide like azithromycin for now. Um and hopefully your symptoms subside and we can get you home. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "OK, that sounds good. Thank you so much.", "doctor": "Yeah, no problem. And I forgot, sorry we'll also probably do like a chest X Ray and a pulmonary function test."}, {"patient": "OK, sounds good.", "doctor": "Yeah, no problem."}]}

Alright, um travel to anywhere recently?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No, OK. Alright, those were all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions that you wanted to ask me today before we end the interview?"}, {"patient": "Uh no, not really. Just wanted to know if, like I remember he did need antibiotics before so I was just wondering if he needs them now.", "doctor": "Yeah, um so, well first, because some of his symptoms overlap with Covid, like the fever especially, we'll do a swab on him anyways um and you should hear those results in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and then it, this picture sounds like acute otitis media, so like an ear infection. And um it's especially likely because he's had them in the past, so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before like um coming up with a management plan. But I'll kind of walk you through what we look at. So if I take a look and I see like a perforated tympanic membrane with like pus, we'd prescribe like 10 days of um antibiotics. If he has some like middle ear effusion, so like some fluids with like a bulging tympanic membrane and he appears to be really ill, uh which from the sounds of it, he sounds ill, he's had this fever for more than two days, we'll also prescribe antibiotics for 10 days. And then, if it's just some middle ear effusion, so just that clear fluid um or just the bulging tympanic membrane, we can just um reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see how he's doing. And if he's worse, again, we'll prescribing prescribe him some antibiotics. Um the antibiotics that we usually prescribe are amoxicillin, and because he doesn't have a penicillin allergy, that should work."}, {"patient": "OK.", "doctor": "Yeah, how does that sound?"}, {"patient": "That sounds good. Thank you so much.", "doctor": "OK, great, thank you."}]}

I was just reading some things up and uh, about tuberculosis, so I was really stressed out today.", "doctor": "Yeah so um, that's definitely high on our differential. So, we'll do a couple of things. We'll do a Covid swab on you um just to rule that in or out, you should hear back for, about those results, in 24 to 48 hours. While you're here in the hospital, we're also going to do a chest X-Ray and or like an AFB smear to see if you have active TB or latent TB. If those come back positive um we will require you to isolate because this uh, because TB is highly infectious and it's airborne. Um so we have a couple of uh, we have like a regimen that we'd put you on. It's called the RIPE medications that we keep you on for two months and then we continue a couple of those for another four months. Um but we will uh keep you here until we have more answers on um like from this TB standpoint. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, that sounds good. Um yeah I'm really worried, but hopefully it's not TB.", "doctor": "Yeah, hopefully it's not, um but if it is, it's it's OK, like um we'll get infectious disease involved. Uh we'll get the isolation going and we'll get you on the correct treatment."}, {"patient": "OK, thank you so much.", "doctor": "Yeah, no problem."}]}

Um so we would like to uh try and do uh what's called a pulmonary function test. That will help us kind of understand uh if she has um asthma or not and then we can try her on um, it's called a short acting beta agonist, so it's a puffer."}, {"patient": "OK.", "doctor": "And uh usually when she gets these types of symptoms, she can use the puffer to help her. Uh and if it um helps her then it's most likely that she does have asthma and she will need um that puffer and then she might also need another puffer, which is an inhaled corticosteroid, um for the future to decrease um the likelihood that this asthma gets worse in the future."}, {"patient": "OK, OK yeah thank you.", "doctor": "Yeah, no worries.

Um, but because you're having shortness of breath, uh, we do need to make sure nothing else is going on as well.

Since you do have a cough, um and right now that, like, is considered a symptom, like, like a potential symptom for COVID, we definitely want to do a COVID swab test for you, which will come back in 24 hours to 48 hours. You should still try and isolate as much as you can away from any roommates, or family members for the next, so, 14 days since you first experienced the, the cough."}, {"patient": "Okay.", "doctor": "Based on, like, public health will call you as well so you can follow their instructions.

But since you're not having too many other symptoms right now, it can just be bronchitis.

And uh, when did your headaches start?"}, {"patient": "Um it's, I guess it's not so much as a headache as just kind of um, just pain in and around the cheeks and just going up to my head.

Um and any allergies uh to medications, foods or environmental allergies?"}, {"patient": "Nope, not that I know of.", "doctor": "Any medications, including over the counter herbal medications?"}, {"patient": "I have uh, I do take uh, Tylenol cold in bed sometimes, to relieve some of the pain and pressure.", "doctor": "That's good, that's good. Is there anything else that makes the the pressure and the pain better?"}, {"patient": "Um, I have done those like, kind of those steam um, therapies. That sometimes helps.", "doctor": "Okay good, good, good. Um, any uh, anything that makes the, that makes it worse? I know that lying on one side, you said, makes things worse for you. Anything else that's made the pressure worse?"}, {"patient": "Um, no, I would say that's, that's about it.", "doctor": "Okay, any changes in your sense of smell?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, definitely. Uh when I get really stuff, stuffy, like I don't really smell anything.", "doctor": "What about sense of taste?"}, {"patient": "Um taste, I guess, like with the smell gone sometimes like the taste feels weird too, but like not, not really.", "doctor": "I see, okay. Um, and any family history of any medical conditions?"}, {"patient": "Um my, my father did have a heart attack in his uh, I think it was late 50s, but he's well and alive right now, so he's fine.", "doctor": "Good. Alright, well that's all the questions I had for you given the symptoms that you've shared with me, it sounds like you might have something called um, rhinosinusitis, uh which is basically inflammation of the sinuses and of the uh, of the nasal cavity or the area inside your nose, and uh, often it's just treated with conservative management, so just continue to take um, Tylenol if that seems to help you, and do the steam therapy. It will take time to get better, um, but if you feel that it's um, it's not getting better in the next week or so, give us a call again and we can maybe see if it's a bacterial infection and see if um, if antibiotics might be needed but oftentimes it's usually a viral infection, and antibiotics are not needed, and sort of just resting and taking care of yourself, um, and trying to manage the symptoms that way can help. Um, but also check your temperature here to see if you have any fevers and uh, go from there. We'll also, I guess, we'll also do a COVID swab because your symptoms do overlap with some of those symptoms. Um, and we'd recommend that you quarantine until at least uh swabs, swab results are out and then public health will let you know what to do."}, {"patient": "Okay.", "doctor": "Do you have any questions for me?"}, {"patient": "Uh no, that's all.

And then you've also developed a fever, but you haven't, or I guess you've been feeling, you've been having chills uh, and we can measure temperature here, and you also had a cough that started yesterday.

Have you noticed any changes there?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no, not that I've really noticed.", "doctor": "What about your sense of smell?"}, {"patient": "Um, my smell, I don't think so, but like sometimes I do feel a bit, like stuffy as well. Like not, not right now, but before when I felt stuffy I lost my sense of smell.", "doctor": "Sure, yeah, okay. Um, okay well that's all the questions I have for you. We'll do a physical exam um, get a chest x-ray done, also examine your neck as well a little bit, just to make sure there's no stiffness or rigidity, have a look inside your mouth, um, listen to your chest."}, {"patient": "Okay.", "doctor": "We will also get a COVID swab done, simply because your symptoms sound very similar to um, or I guess a lot of these symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID, so we'll do that. And um, I would require, would request that you continue to uh, stay at home if you haven't been doing so so far. Um, take a leave from work, try to do work from home, and quarantine at home as much as possible and stay away from your wife and your daughter as well, at least until the swab is back and you get some more guidance from uh, public health. If it is positive, they will give you a call. Um, there are lots of guidelines on how to self isolate and I, I can share that with you. Um, it's best that you do that for now. Um, we will run a couple of tests, do labs, and based on those results, uh, we'll decide if you need to stay in the ER or if we can um, if you can be discharged later today. Do you have any questions for me?"}, {"patient": "Uh no that, that all sounds great. Thanks for explaining it to me.", "doctor": "You're welcome."}]}

What do you do to make it go away?"}, {"patient": "Uh, I just basically have to, if I, if I'm doing any kind of activities, just take a moment, sit down for like 10 to 15 minutes and then it seems like it goes away on its own.", "doctor": "And you said that sometimes you also have difficulties breathing with it?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, like a couple of times it got really bad where I had to um like, it was difficult get, it was, it was like I was trying to take deep breaths for air, but uh it was, it just felt like I couldn't.", "doctor": "I see.

Does it sound different than when you're sort of coughing to clear your throat, for instance?"}, {"patient": "Uh yeah, it's like pretty, it can get pretty harsh. I also noticed like uh, there's like this weird noise I started making like right after when I'm trying to take deep breaths in.", "doctor": "Okay, okay. Okay, so you're wheezing. Okay, so you ever um, cough so much that you end up vomiting?"}, {"patient": "No, no that hasn't happen yet.", "doctor": "Um, and do you, so you mentioned that it's worse when you're in the cold or exercising, and smoking makes it worse? What about things like dust or pollen? Um, say when you're cleaning the house and there's also dust, does that make things worse, or is it worse in a specific time of the year when you're outdoors?"}, {"patient": "Uh, now that you mention it, yeah, like if we're ever in the basement or anything like that, I, I do start getting like kind of irritation um, in my throat, and that kind of, sometimes I have also coughed at those times.", "doctor": "Alright.

Just for some eczema on my hands.", "doctor": "Okay. And um, have you ever had allergic rhinitis, which is basically sort of having um, red or teary eyes, itchiness on the face, a runny nose at certain times of the year, or in um, areas with mold or dust, or termites and things like that?

Maybe just like environmental allergies sometimes, in the springtime.", "doctor": "What happens then?"}, {"patient": "Um, just sometimes like uh, I don't know if it's like a pollen allergy like I, I do get some, I guess I do get like some nasal congestion and things like that.", "doctor": "Um, have you ever seen an allergist?"}, {"patient": "No, I haven't.", "doctor": "No. Uh, who prescribed the cream for the eczema?"}, {"patient": "Um, just a, it was like at a walk-in clinic.", "doctor": "Okay, okay. Um alright, and do you have any family history of any um, lung-related problems? Or any other problems?"}, {"patient": "Um, my older sister has asthma, and uh, I don't know if anyone else in the family has asthma.

Just wanted to mention that the conversation that we're having right now is confidential between you and me. Um, unless you mentioned anything that harms you or harms anyone else so, so feel free to discuss whatever or talk openly about um, any issues that you have. Um, okay, and um, are you sexually active?"}, {"patient": "No, no.", "doctor": "Alright, okay. So um, that's all the information I needed. Uh given that you've had these coughing fits for the past couple of months that are, that have certain triggers, uh, and also given that you've had a history of eczema, and your sister has asthma, so kind of, sort of runs in your family in a way. You might also have a diagnosis of asthma potentially. Um, and so, what I would recommend is that you get um, testing done and um, uh I guess before I sort of talk a little more about this, I just want to get a sense of how severe your asthma, if it's asthma at all, um if, does it, does it affect your ability to, you said school was going okay, does it affect your ability to do well at school at all?"}, {"patient": "Um definitely in, in gym class, but other than that it hasn't really affected me.", "doctor": "Does it wake you up at night?"}, {"patient": "No, so far no. I, I like, I get pretty good sleep.", "doctor": "Okay, okay. Um, and how often, I guess is, do these episodes occur? How many times a week, or how many times a month?"}, {"patient": "Uh, so they just started like two months ago, and I've had like maybe four or five of them in total.", "doctor": "Okay, okay. Uh, and they kind of get better on their own. Okay, so we can sort of talk about these, sorry, puffers that you might need to, to use as needed. Um, your sister might have some of those, so you might be familiar with what I'm talking about."}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "Um, so we can talk about that. Um, given that your symptoms are, yes, they've been occurring for the past couple of months, but because you have had a cough, it might be a good idea just to have a COVID test done once. Um, I don't think that's what you have, seeing that this, these symptoms have been lasting for, have been occurring for the past two months, so we'll just kind of do that test to rule it out. Um, in the meantime, I would recommend that you um, try this inhaled corticosteroid puffer that you can use, that you should use on a daily basis, and try to avoid uh, the triggers. So the things that you, that cause these symptoms. Um, we can go over how to use uh, a puffer properly and I will also give you a spacer, which will help deliver most of that medication in the, uh, to your lungs. Do you have any questions?"}]}

And um, are you just, are you using anything to help you quit smoking or are you doing it without any medications, or um, like, have you used anything in the past that has worked for you?"}, {"patient": "Um, no I, I went to my doc and he said to try on my own first and if I'm struggling with it to come back, but I've been doing it very gradually so it's, it's going well.", "doctor": "Okay, and that's really good. And yeah, if you, at all, need any resources to help you quit smoking, it's great that you're doing really well, but if you need to talk more about it or need any more resources we can provide that for you.

Maybe a glass or two of wine.", "doctor": "Okay, and uh yeah. So those were kind of all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No?"}, {"patient": "I was, I guess I was just worried about the cough um, it's just, I was worried that it could be COVID.", "doctor": "Yeah, so definitely right now, any of these symptoms, like COVID can have a lot of different symptoms um, so we should definitely make sure that we, to check if you have COVID or not and we'll get a COVID swab test done for you today, and the results will come back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh, and in that time, you will need to isolate even in your own home. Try to wear a mask around your family members, um, trying to eat separately and use all those methods, and, and then after the test comes back you may, you'll be contacted by public health if it's positive and kind of given more instruction on what to do. And it doesn't necessarily have to be COVID either, it can be just another virus uh, like it can be just your common cold that's been going on. So it does seem that your symptoms have gotten better. Oftentimes uh, a cough can be the last thing to go, it can take up to two weeks or more for the cough to get relieved, but it seems that you're not having any systemic symptoms like no fevers or anything else right now, so it's, it's uh, that's, that's pretty good."}, {"patient": "Great, I'm glad.", "doctor": "Alright, yeah."}, {"patient": "Thank you.", "doctor": "You're welcome.

Like I'm not gonna live a lot longer anyway.", "doctor": "Yeah yeah but also even if you try to cut down some of your symptoms might get better. Like even though you're 75, you can definitely have improvement in some of your symptoms that you're having, like the shortness of breath and coughing.

I'm thinking this is exactly that and I'll have to stay in the hospital, right? for a couple of days", "doctor": "Yeah, so we definitely before deciding on whether or not you should be admitted, since you said the Ventolin is not working for you, we will definitely give you some some ventilation and perhaps steroid for just to get rid of some of your symptoms right now, and we want to also make sure since you're having like cough as well as shortness of breath to do a covid swab on you, just in case. I know you've been like isolating and everything, but just in case I will do that and we'll get like a chest x ray on you as well, just to see if there's any kind of pneumonia going on. And then from there we'll also get your blood work, and then from there we'll see whether or not you will require another admission."}, {"patient": "Sure.", "doctor": "OK, and there you might, I'm not 100% sure, but you might require home oxygen if like we take your vitals and everything and your oxygenation is very low. Have you have you been talked about that at all in the past?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, they talked about it last time I've been trying to avoid it, but if it has to happen, it has to happen.", "doctor": "Hmm yeah, and it might just sometimes just, you know you've had four admissions in the past and it might actually just help you stay at home if you are on oxygen. Anyways, yeah we can talk about that. We'll do like a full physical examination everything and go from there."}, {"patient": "Sure.", "doctor": "Great, I'll be with you shortly."}]}

I'm just sick and tired of my runny nose.", "doctor": "Yeah, it must be very frustrating. So you've tried Reactin before, right?"}, {"patient": "yeah", "doctor": "Yeah, so one method is to definitely like stay away from some of those allergens that are potentially causing your symptoms. But I I do really think so you might have something called like allergic rhinitis. And I think it might be beneficial to for you to see like an allergist"}, {"patient": "sure.", "doctor": "And so I can refer you to someone as well. Just have a sense of what kind of things allergic to you and like what medications you would require. In the meantime, definitely like any antihistamine medications would help with your symptoms. But since you're also having congestion and sneezing, just just in case, we will just do a COVID swab test for you today. And it takes around 24 to 48 hours to come back. And in the meantime, you should just isolate as much as you can in your own home. And then based on the result they would give you more instruction."}, {"patient": "Sure", "doctor": "Alright.

I'd have to take a look into his ear to be able to tell more uhm because some of his symptoms overlap with those of covid we'll probably do a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm and so after I take a look into his ears, we can do one of a couple of things, so if his tympanic membrane looks like it's been perforated, or if there's pus in there, then we'll prescribe him a 10 day course of antibiotics, and if I see like middle ear effusion or his tympanic membranes bulging, and he seems really sick like he has a high fever, what she does, I will again prescribe him 10 days of antibiotics. And if he has a middle ear effusion or a bulging tympanic membrane, just one of those two, and he doesn't seem to be too sick, we can reassess him in 24 to 48 hours.

Okay, and um, are you up to date with all your immunizations?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, yeah, I remember getting one not too long ago, actually. Well, seven years ago I guess now, but I didn't realize, that we uh, had to get anymore.", "doctor": "Um, so yeah, after you turn 65, they should've given you the Shingrix for shingles and pneumococcal vaccine, does that sound familiar?"}, {"patient": "Yeah it does.

Any allergies that you have?"}, {"patient": "Uh, I don't think so.", "doctor": "No. How about family history of lung or heart conditions?"}, {"patient": "My uh, grandfather had, had lung cancer. And he was in his uh, 70s when he, when he passed away, I remember.", "doctor": "Okay, okay. And do you currently smoke?"}, {"patient": "I do, yes.

I've been spending a lot of time at at home uh, with my husband, and he's been okay.", "doctor": "Okay, good. How about travel?"}, {"patient": "No, we've been pretty scared with uh, COVID and all that, so we've been staying, staying home for the most part.", "doctor": "Okay, okay, good. Um, those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"}, {"patient": "No, I was just really concerned when I started to see um, the blood coming up more recently, and so I was just hoping to get this figured out.", "doctor": "Yeah, for sure. Um, so they're a couple of things we're gonna work you up for. Um, because some of your symptoms overlap with COVID, we'll start by getting a COVID swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Um, we will also do a chest x-ray um, to look for any signs of lung cancer. Um, and then if we see consolidation or anything that would indicate um, like a mass in your lungs, we will discuss options for like biopsies which is the gold standard for diagnosing lung cancers. Also, I know you haven't had any recent travel or anything like that and your symptoms have been going on for a long time, but uh, it may also be worthwhile to uh, also check for things like TB, which could also cause you to cough up blood. Um, so we'll start, we'll start from there, and then if those come back negative, then we'll work you up further for other things that you may have, but are like more rare. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "That sounds like a good plan. Thank you.", "doctor": "Okay, great. No problem."}]}

Okay, well those were all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions um, or anything that you wanted to bring up that I haven't covered?"}, {"patient": "No, that's it. I was just uh, I mean concerned about COVID. I've been hearing about this new variant and stuff on the news so, a little bit worried.", "doctor": "Yeah for sure. We will definitely um, take a swab from you today and we'll see um, what the results are. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but in the meantime you should self isolate for 14 days um, and if it's not COVID, if that comes back negative, and um yeah, some of your symptoms also sound like other typical viral symptoms, so you could have one of the common strains that's going around this time of year. So for that just, it's um, you should just um, do some supportive care, you know, staying hydrated, eating well. And if your symptoms become worse, uh, you're running a really high fever, you have any neurological symptoms like weakness or seizures, then you should seek help from the ER.

The test where you had to breathe into a tube."}, {"patient": "Um yeah, I had that done like five years ago.", "doctor": "Okay, um, alright um, just wanted to see if it was uh like formally diagnosed. Sometimes people uh, um, yeah, it's important to have that, uh, those tests done. Um, and do you have any allergies?"}, {"patient": "Um, no none. None, yeah.", "doctor": "Okay. Um, and uh, are your immunizations up to date?"}, {"patient": "Yes, I believe so.", "doctor": "Okay, um and have you had any surgeries or, or um, hospitalizations?"}, {"patient": "Um, I had my Gallbladder removed when I was in my 50s.

Um, was there anything else that you wanted to add that I maybe forgot?"}, {"patient": "Um, no, that's about it, but I, how can I treat myself now? How do I make this cough go away?", "doctor": "For sure, so, um, we will first get your vitals here and we'll see if your oxygen levels um, are low, then it would be important to put on some oxygen first, um, just to make sure that that's stable. Um, and from there we will um, get a chest x-ray um, and uh, run some lab work to, to try to help figure out the, the diagnosis better, but in the meantime, we'll use um, some inhalers because it's possible that this is a COPD exacerbation similar to uh last year, um, and the inhalers should help open up the airways and dilate, so make breathing easier, and then um, also if it is a COPD exacerbation, it will likely require antibiotics, as well as some steroids for the, the inflammation for five days. Uh, but since your symptoms currently overlap with uh, COVID as well, you'll have to get a, a COVID nasal swab."}, {"patient": "Okay, okay for sure.", "doctor": "Okay, so uh, we'll get that started."}]}

Was there anything else that you wanted to add?"}, {"patient": "Oh, nothing that I want to add. I just, what do you, how do you think I can make this, make my voice better? And how long will I have, have this horse voice?", "doctor": "Yeah, so uh, right now it's sounding like um, a viral type illness where there's inflammation of the vocal cords, uh, with having the cough and the runny nose a couple of days ago. Actually, this reminds me that. Have you, I'm not sure if I asked about fevers or chills, if you have any?"}, {"patient": "Uh no, I haven't.", "doctor": "Okay, um, and so for, if it is a viral infection then, um, it's just supportive kind of management. So that will mean trying to stay as hydrated as you possibly can over these next um, next few days and then also you can use things like, if they help, like lozenges or something along those lines. Um, but it will, it will just take some time for it to come back on its own, a few days to a couple of weeks sometimes. And the cough could possibly last for um, two to four weeks after um, after having a viral type illness."}, {"patient": "Okay.", "doctor": "Yeah, so it could be quite a few weeks that the symptoms last for. But since you're having a cough, and these symptoms could overlap with COVID we'll want to get a COVID swab today as well um, and kind of go from there."}]}

Um, do you think um, I need to be hospitalized, um, because I'm very short of breath, or do you think I can just um, stay at home? Do you think I need antibiotics?", "doctor": "Yeah, so we'll, we'll check your temperature and, and confirm the fever and um, check your oxygen levels as well. You might need oxygen, um, you're mentioning, with your shortness of breath. Um, and we will get a chest x-ray, and if um, we're seeing consolidation there, suggestive of pneumonia, you may need antibiotics that will cover, cover those, those bugs. However, your symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, and so it will be important to get a, um, COVID swab. But to answer if you will need a hospital stay, I think we'll need to at least wait until some of the investigations come back and, um, that will help determine how severe the symptoms are and we'll observe you over the next few hours, and if you are getting any worse or um, anything like that, then it might be a good idea, um, to uh, to be admitted."}, {"patient": "Okay. Okay yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.", "doctor": "You're welcome."}]}

But I also think, since you were very drowsy and were, had fallen asleep and were really difficult to wake up, sometimes you can get what's called aspiration pneumonia. Um, and that's, that can also be a possibility and what we will do is get a chest x-ray, get some blood work done as well today. Um, now we may require antibiotics, and if your vitals unstable we might actually admit you as well. Um, does that sound good?"}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "Alright, so yeah, we'll get those tests done and we'll be there with you shortly. We'll also get like an EKG done as well."}, {"patient": "Sure.", "doctor": "Alright, okay."}]}

Is it a dry cough or is she bringing anything up?"}, {"patient": "Um, it is a, it is a dry cough, um, but she just keeps coughing and coughing and, and then she just, you know, once she'll start coughing she just doesn't stop. And then um, there's been times when she just turns blue, she's coughing so much. Um, and then it just gets, gets better um, on its own. But yeah, it's a dry cough.", "doctor": "Okay, and um, what does the cough sound like? Is it like a harsh cough, a barky cough?"}, {"patient": "Um, it's just, she just makes this noise when she's like breathe, trying to take a breath in. It's, it's yeah.", "doctor": "Okay, is it kind of a wheeze?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, sure.", "doctor": "Okay. Um, and so there's episodes where she also turns blue?"}, {"patient": "When she's coughing a lot, yeah, she does.", "doctor": "Okay."}, {"patient": "She's also vomited once or twice.", "doctor": "Oh, I see, okay. Um, any blood in the vomit? Or is she coughing up any blood?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No, okay. Um, any, so this started two weeks ago, any kind of symptoms of runny nose or um, cold-like symptoms before then?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, yeah she did have a bit of a runny nose. It was just uh, watery, uh, since discharge. And at that time her cough, she had a cough as well. Um, but I thought it was, you know, it's nothing. It was just like another flu and it would get better, but then she just, the runny nose got better without, in a couple of days, but the cough stayed. And it got, got pretty worse, uh, it got worse.", "doctor": "Okay, um, other than the cough uh, any, any fevers or chills?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't think she's had fevers. I haven't checked, though.", "doctor": "Okay. And the cough is pretty constant, or is it, does it come and go?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, she just has these episodes where she just coughs and coughs and coughs, and then she'll either vomit or just turn blue, or just um, get better in a couple, couple minutes. This kind of comes and goes like that.", "doctor": "Okay. And is there anything that has helped her at all? Like any over the counter medications or anything like that?"}, {"patient": "I haven't tried anything, I'm just worried about, you know she's my first child and I don't know what to give her and what not to give her at this age. So I just decided to come in and not try anything over the counter.", "doctor": "Okay. Um, and so, has this happened before at all?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No, this is the first time, okay. Um, any so, she, she is vomiting. Um, is the vomit like green in colour? Or is she just vomiting up what she has eaten? What's the content of the moment?"}, {"patient": "It's usually just what she's eaten.", "doctor": "Okay, um, any sick contacts recently or any travel?"}, {"patient": "No, I don't think so. Not, nothing really.", "doctor": "Um, and how about her behaviour? Does she seem like uh, very tired or fatigued, or more irritable?"}, {"patient": "She does get tired, especially after, and then she's irritable and crying after, you know, she has these fits of coughs.", "doctor": "Okay."}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "Okay. Um, any symptoms of diarrhea or constipation?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Okay. Any um, any trouble with urinating at all?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "No. How's her sleeping like?"}, {"patient": "Uh, not great. It's just the cough keeps uh, waking her up and she just doesn't, can't fall asleep.", "doctor": "Okay, any uh, exposure to dust or fumes, or animals or pets at home?"}, {"patient": "We, we did get a cat um, about a month ago.", "doctor": "Okay. Um, and any, has she been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Um, and any allergies that you know of?"}, {"patient": "Um, no.", "doctor": "And um, any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "And how was your pregnancy, your pregnancy with her, like any complications at all?"}, {"patient": "No, no complications. It was uh, it was very, yeah, it went well.", "doctor": "And was she at term or premature?"}, {"patient": "She was at term, she was born at term.", "doctor": "Was it a vaginal delivery or uh, a c-section?"}, {"patient": "Uh, vaginal.", "doctor": "And did she have to stay in the NICU at all, at the hospital afterwards?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Okay.

She's doing uh, she eats everything, yeah.", "doctor": "Um, and any family history of any medical conditions?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Um, and does anyone smoke in the house?"}, {"patient": "Um, her dad, but he, he doesn't smoke in front of her.", "doctor": "And what's her living situation like? Who does she live with? And do you live in a house, apartment?"}, {"patient": "Oh yeah, we live in an apartment. It's uh, me, my partner, her and the cat.", "doctor": "Okay. And any difficulties or complications with her growth? Like in terms of her weight or her height?"}, {"patient": "No, no complications. She's doing okay.", "doctor": "Okay. And in terms of her milestones, has she been meeting all of them on time?"}, {"patient": "Yes.", "doctor": "Okay. Alright, so I think those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?"}, {"patient": "Uh, no.", "doctor": "Yeah, so based on the symptoms, oh yeah, sorry I forgot to ask one other question. Has she, are her immunizations all up to date?"}, {"patient": "Oh no, no. I don't, I don't get those. My friend's, my friend's daughter developed autism and I'm just, I don't want that, you know, so no. I don't vaccinate my kids. Or I don't vaccinate my daughter and I haven't been. Yeah, uh no, I won't be doing that.", "doctor": "And have you been vaccinated throughout your life?"}, {"patient": "Um, maybe when I was young, but I, yeah I don't, I just don't believe in vaccinations. I, yeah, no, I don't, I don't get those.", "doctor": "Yeah, so there is definitely uh, there's a lot of research done beside, behind vaccinations and a lot of prevention goes into them, but definitely there is some anecdotal evidence of very loose associations to autism that have been found to be invalid and like they have been invalidated by the research. So definitely, it's very important to get your child vaccinated. In fact, the sum of the symptoms that your child may be having right now can be caused by something called pertussis, and um, there's usually a vaccination for that. Like after pregnancy as well, so that's something that is definitely on the differential, and at this time we definitely need to make sure she's okay and get her vitals done, see her oxygenation saturation, and just do supportive care while she's in the hospital, and we may need to admit her, but we'll do the full physical examination today, get a COVID swab done as well. And usually it, she's currently in the, it seems to be the second phase, where she's vomiting and coughing a lot, and then it usually, after that phase, two or three more weeks of just coughing. And so, we're going to do some supportive care for her right now, but yeah, definitely, you should consider vaccinating your child. We recommend that to every parent as there's a lot of diseases out there that can be completely prevented if you vaccinate your child."}, {"patient": "Okay, I'll think about it.", "doctor": "Alright, so, so for now we're gonna just make sure that she's doing well, okay?"}, {"patient": "Sure.", "doctor": "Alright, take care."}]}

Do you ever have any night sweats or anything like that?"}, {"patient": "No.", "doctor": "Okay. So there's a few things that we think about with the chronic shortness of breath and a cough. One could be just a COPD diagnosis with your long history of smoking. And this pulmonary function test, get an x-ray, chest x-ray as well. Um another thing that we need to look out for is uh, lung cancer. And since you have been smoking for a pretty long time, even though you may have quit, which is really great, but that long history of smoking, especially also with um, you working in a mine, those are some things that means we can test as well, and so we may require like a chest x-ray, and even um, a CT scan of your lungs as well. Um, so yeah, first we'll just do a couple tests, do a physical examination, get your vitals, do some blood work and do some of those tests and then we'll also get a COVID swab test done for you as well, just in case.

I've been trying to stay away from it though, just taking Tylenol instead.", "doctor": "Is your pain controlled well with Tylenol?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I tried to suck it up. I just don't wanna go on those other medications. I've heard like, you can get addicted to them.", "doctor": "Yeah, that's fair, that's a fair point. But it's also, I guess it's important that you move around at home. Um, so maybe try to, maybe we can increase your Tylenol dose, or maybe um, see if there's another pain med that you can be started on if you're not interested in opioids, just to make sure that you're moving around 'cause that's very important.

We'll also do an ultrasound of your leg, and then um, we might have to treat, uh, this with blood thinners.

It could have, it could be potentially that you had a viral infection initially and might you might have like a superimposed bacterial infection, but we don't know that for sure. Uhm, we, we'll do a physical exam. Have a listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth, look at your throat. Uhm, we, uhm, I guess the original symptoms you had last week., uhm, were seem a little bit different. It could be pharyngitis, maybe what you have right now could potentially be pharyngitis with a sore throat and the fever that you've developed over the past three or four days. So, I'll definitely have a look inside your throat as well, and if necessary we could do a rapid strep test. Uhm, and we would also have to do a Covid test just in case, and I would recommend that you quarantine at home. The results should come out in the next 12 to 20 for 24 to 48 hours. Just self isolate, stay away from other family members and then you'll find out the results. If it's positive, someone will call you from public health and then let you know what to do."}, {"patient": "OK, yeah, that sounds good.", "doctor": "Alright."}, {"patient": "Thank you.", "doctor": "Yeah, you're welcome."}]}

It's also possible that you just have a, just the common cold and that would get better over time.

So, continue to eat well and continue to drink lots of water. I guess so what we'll do is we'll do a COVID swab just to just to check if you have COVID or not. We'll also do a few labs to see how your electrolytes are, do your vitals to see if you have fever, measure your heart rate and do a physical exam and then go from there.

So, I guess from the symptoms that you've described, it sounds like you likely have a condition called acute rhinosinusitis where you have inflammation of the sinuses in your face and potentially some inflammation in your nose as well, and often it's caused by a virus and it usually gets better in a couple of weeks. And the best thing to do is just conservative management. Try to rest and, if, if you know taking any medications, over the counter medications is helping you feel better, if you feel like Tylenol, sort of reducing some of that pressure or if doing a, taking a steam bath is sort of helping relieve that pressure, try those. Drink a lot of water to try to sort of lear out all that mucus that's that's building up. I'll also do a physical exam and talk to my attending and confirm all this information with him and we can go from there."}, {"patient": "Great sounds good, thank you.", "doctor": "Uhm, also sorry before for in the call because the symptoms are started recently and they do uhm, overlap with some of the symptoms that if patient with COVID might have, it might be a good idea to get a COVID swab done as well, so we'll do that today and you would have to quarantine and stay away from the people at your home as well, until the results are out, and then if it's positive, public health will let you know what to do."}, {"patient": "Alright, sounds good.

Uhm, Rabeprazole?", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "Yeah.", "doctor": "Alright and are you up to date with all your immunizations?"}, {"patient": "Uh, yeah.", "doctor": "Including like the pneumovax vaccine and the shingrix?"}, {"patient": "I had the shingrix the pneumo I think the doctor said we were going to look at that the next time I came in.", "doctor": "OK, sure."}, {"patient": "So I I'm not sure I I know that I always say yes to these things, but I'm not sure because of Covid and stuff if I've been getting everything exactly on time.", "doctor": "Mhmm. OK, and how about uh, how about allergies? Do you have any allergies?"}, {"patient": "Oh, like uh, just seasonal. Not to any medications or anything.", "doctor": "OK. Uhm, have you been in touch with anyone sick recently around you?"}, {"patient": "No, like the only person I see is my husband. I guess him, and so he has a PSW that comes in to take care of him. He has a couple more problems than I do. So basically, we see I see him and her and we see we see our kids, but just like outside.", "doctor": "OK. OK and alright and then, uhm, have you traveled anywhere recently?"}, {"patient": "No, no", "doctor": "No, OK. Dietary wise, are you like eating healthy?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, yeah, I think so. I try to, you know, cook, you know, whole foods for us like lots of veggies and you know fish and good meat. Although in the past you know few days, I just 'cause I felt really rundown and fatigued, I haven't been eating as much as I normally do.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "Otherwise, I think we pretty healthy I try to, you know, follow healthy recipes and find them online.", "doctor": "Yeah, for sure.

Any old carpets or dust or mold or asbestos in the, in the home?"}, {"patient": "No, no we renovated probably 15 years ago, and there's no no more carpet, and there were never any asbestos problems or anything.", "doctor": "OK. OK, well I think those are all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions for myself?"}, {"patient": "I don't think so. I just I hope you know we can get this figured out.", "doctor": "Yeah, for sure. So we'll start with doing a Covid swab because you have some symptoms that overlap with it, so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. But it does sound like what you're telling me with the wet cough and you know a little bit of shortness of breath, I think it's worthwhile to get a chest x-ray to see if you might possibly have a pneumonia, and if you do, if there is some consolidation we'll probably prescribe some antibiotics for that. Umm, how does that sound to you?"}, {"patient": "Sounds great to me. Yeah, I just you know, hope there's nothing serious going on.", "doctor": "Yeah, yeah, and it shouldn't be. It's probably 1 something that's been going around in the community and you haven't had any recent hospitalizations or surgery, so I wouldn't worry about like any of those atypical bugs just yet."}, {"patient": "OK, OK, that's good to hear.", "doctor": "Yeah, for sure. Well, uhm, thank you."}]}

Like sometimes it's kind of hard to smell because it's so plugged up.", "doctor": "Right."}, {"patient": "I still have like I'm able to smell like, especially after I do the rinses. It helps a little bit.", "doctor": "OK, how about like a chest pain?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, no, I haven't had any chest pain.", "doctor": "No, OK.

Are you otherwise healthy or do you have any longstanding medical conditions?"}, {"patient": "No, this is pretty well, pretty well the only thing.

Umm, and then I occasionally will use like, like an Advil if my knees sore.", "doctor": "OK. OK, and no hospitalizations or surgeries?"}, {"patient": "Uh, so I had an ACL repair surgery.", "doctor": "Oh right, yeah, OK."}, {"patient": "And like I went to the emergency department once when I had a bad sinus infection, but I didn't like stay over at the hospital.", "doctor": "OK, OK.

Do you drink alcohol?"}, {"patient": "I drink a few beers on the weekend.", "doctor": "OK."}, {"patient": "You know five or six per weekend.", "doctor": "OK. And then, five or six for weekend. OK and any recreational drugs?"}, {"patient": "I will occasionally take like a cannabis, like a capsule like the oil in the capsule.", "doctor": "OK, and what is that for?"}, {"patient": "Just like recreational. Also like I mean my knee, my knee pain. Sometimes it helps.", "doctor": "Mhmm, OK."}, {"patient": "But essentially that that might be like once like per month or something.", "doctor": "OK. OK.

It's a labradoodle.", "doctor": "OK, yeah."}, {"patient": "And that's it, yeah.", "doctor": "How long have you had him?"}, {"patient": "Oh, like, he's like 3 now. Like my sinus infections and that have been going on for longer than we've had him.", "doctor": "OK, alright. Those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?"}, {"patient": "I don't think so. I just I hope you know, we can do something about this. Because you know, I tried all this stuff that is supposed to be like, you know, conservative like the first steps and it just doesn't seem like it's getting better. It's been like few weeks. So, I thought it was probably time to come see you.", "doctor": "Yeah, sorry. What have you tried at home again?"}, {"patient": "So I use the, the rinses the saline rinses. I used a little bit of nasal decongestant but I know like I know I've been told I'm not supposed to do that for more than a few days, so I don't. Yeah, that's, I think that's pretty well it 'cause they said there's not much we can really do.", "doctor": "OK, yeah. So your symptoms, OK because some some of these things overlap with Covid, we're going to have to swab you and they'll notify you of your results in like 24 to 48 hours. But what it sounds like is something called Sinu, Sinusitis and it sounds like acute bacterial rhinosinusitis because of some f the symptoms that you have, and it's been going on for more than a week and it's, it's not going away with the rinse, saline rinses and these decongestants. So we will prescribe some antibiotics for you. Probably amoxicillin. Take those for five to seven days and see if some of your symptoms clear up. If they continue to be severe, umm, actually, at this will also prescribe you some inhaled corticosteroids because I think those can help as well, so will give you both of those for now and then just follow up with us in a week after you've tried both things and we'll see how your symptoms are holding up at that point. Does that sound like a good plan to you?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I think that sounds that sounds fair. Yeah, thank you.", "doctor": "OK, yeah no problem."}]}

In the past couple of days or no?"}, {"patient": "I know I've taken the last couple of days off, just been so tired and not feeling good so, yeah well.", "doctor": "OK, OK. So yeah, it sounds like you might have some sort of viral infection which could potentially be covid, but could also be another sort of another viral illness, just like the common cold or the flu. Um, so I'll request that we get a covid swab done and the results should come back in 24 to 48 hours and um, just try to self isolate as much as possible. Don't go to school, don't meet other people. Try to stay away from your mom as well. And based on the results, you'll get more guidance from public health nurses, and you should just continue to sort of rest and drink lots of water. Maybe take Tylenol or Advil if that's making you feel better and hopefully your symptoms will get better. If not, if you feel like your symptoms are persisting for days or week or so, or you're having worsening symptoms, definitely come back or give us a call."}]}

Yeah, he that when I think particularly at soccer practice school have a really hard time catching his breath, but like he would, he stops playing and rests and really tries to make sure that he is I don't know, just trying to to breathe and it kind of goes away. He's been able to manage it OK.", "doctor": "OK, alright and I have these symptoms that have interfered with his daily activities? Does he for instance, try to avoid soccer practice.

He does get symptoms like a runny nose and itchy eyes sometimes, but usually go away pretty pretty quickly and he doesn't fuss about it too much so, yeah so.", "doctor": "From the symptoms that you've described so far, it sounds like he might also have asthma, but we will obviously have to do some testing and confirm that. Uhm, and also, it's given sort of the results, or even just like giving his symptoms, prescribe some buffers to help with those symptoms. Clearly it's affecting his life. He can't go to school or can't participate in soccer, or sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night, and that's not good. So, we'll we can be prescribed some puffers and see if those help and also get some testing done. Do you have any other questions for me?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, No, yeah I was just wondering about, so like the wheezing and all of that could be with from asthma too?", "doctor": "Uhm, yeah, I would think so, but again, we'll get the testing done and see if there are any other, any other causes."}, {"patient": "Ok.", "doctor": "You said the wheezing sort of lasts only 30 to 30 minutes to an hour and then gets better?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I don't notice that any other times.", "doctor": "Yes, it's possibly, I mean, I would think it's asthma, but then we'll get the testing done and see."}]}

You haven't ever had one, have you?"}, {"patient": "No, I I haven't had anything like that.", "doctor": "OK, alright. So. I guess come to in terms of smoking, you said that you've tried to quit a couple of times in the past. Do you intend on trying again? I know it can be very hard to, to quit smoking."}, {"patient": "Yeah, it's only something that is always kind of in the back of my mind.", "doctor": "OK, if there's I'm happy to assist you and share resources and problems like medications and things like that that could help you if you're interested so we can talk more about that. talking about your I guess you mentioned that your weight is a little higher than or, its outside the normal range, is that something that you would like to cut down?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, I really try to eat more vegetables and have been trying to do that sort of thing. I've lost a few pounds, but not enough, definitely want to keep going.", "doctor": "OK, good good, as long as you feel that you what you're currently doing is helping you and is helping you reduce weight. That's great. But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications."}, {"patient": "OK, yeah, that sounds really good. Thank you.", "doctor": "Welcome."}]}

Given that your symptoms sort of sound like you may have a viral or bacterial infection and seeing that you were, you had some exposure to to other people even though they weren't sick, it could, it could be that they, they had some sort of an illness that they could transmit that they weren't just showing symptoms at the time. We will get a covid swab done just to make sure that that's not what's happening. It could be that. And I'll recommend that you continue to, you know, take Tylenol and rest and take care of yourself and if your symptoms worsen or stay the same for long period of time, definitely come back or call public health to get some guidance and try to stay away from others and self isolate for the next couple of days or at least clear covid swabs back or your symptoms improve.

Umm, so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?"}, {"patient": "Uhm, no, I, no that was everything I think. The only I I guess other thing that that I forgot to mention is that just he doesn't really like his appetite's been a little bit lower couple of days as well. But uh, he hasn't had any, like nausea or vomiting though.", "doctor": "OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "That sounds great.

Did you have any questions of your own?"}, {"patient": "No, I I I just wanted to figure out what this was.", "doctor": "OK, yeah, so it sounds or actually I should start by saying we should get a Covid swab on him just in case it is Covid because some of his symptoms overlap with those symptoms of Covid. Umm, you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with the results of those swabs. And in the meantime, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year. And from the sounds of it, you said he has a fever. He's coughing and he has a runny nose and has muscle aches. It could also be the flu. Regardless of what kind of viral and viral infection he has, the best way to manage it right now is just supportive care, so making sure he's hydrated, eating foods with a lot of nutrition and just keep an eye on his symptoms. If it gets worse or if it's very severe and he has focal neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, take him to the ER right away. How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, that sounds good.

So that is quite high on my differential right now just because of your age, your smoking history and just the way you're presenting. So we're gonna do a couple of things. We're going to do a Covid swab just to rule that out. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but we will do investigations for lung cancer, so we'll start by doing a chest x-ray just to look for a mass or effusions and then from there if we think there are signs of cancer, we can do a CT. Umm, as well we can like stage with the Pet CT after we take a biopsy and send it off for pathology and that should give us more answers as to if you have cancer and if you do have cancer, what type of cancer so that we can talk about treatment plans and kind of what the prognosis is with those particular types of cancers? How does that sound?"}, {"patient": "Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you so much.", "doctor": "OK yeah, no problem."}]}

So we are, you're a lot of your symptoms do overlap with those of Covid, so we are going to take a swab today and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but you should isolate for 14 days. And that includes from family family members if possible. Uhm, and basically just keep an eye on your symptoms. If they get worse, or you're having like neurological symptoms, you should seek help from the ER, but otherwise keep yourself hydrated, eat well. If you have a humidifier in the basement, use it, and for your fevers you can take antipyretics like Tylenol. And just it's it's just a lot of supportive care. How does that sound and obviously like if your symptoms aren't going away after like a few weeks, call us back and it could be something like bacterial, in which case we can give you some antibiotics."}, {"patient": "OK yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.", "doctor": "Yeah, no problem."}]}
